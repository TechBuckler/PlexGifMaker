1
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,647
O'Donnell, save something
for the game.

2
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,814
I'm just warming up, coach.

3
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,482
Just talked to the scout again.
He's coming tonight.

4
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,901
You play half the game
I know you're capable of...

5
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,279
...he's prepared to offer you
a full scholarship.

6
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,490
Free ride to college
and the world's your oyster, kid.

7
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,993
Thanks, coach.

8
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,788
All right, jockstraps,
let's gather up. Picture time.

9
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,248
Try not to break the camera.

10
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,918
We gotta hang on.
Ned's not here yet.

11
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,670
Who cares? He's the water boy.

12
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,173
That doesn't matter,
because he's part of the team.

13
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,842
Sorry I'm late! Sorry I'm late!

14
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,679
But what kind of Dungeon Master
would I be...

15
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:39,057
...if I left my party in the middle
of a battle with a hippogriff?

16
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,143
Check it out, it's Merlin the Girlin.

17
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,982
Um, Ned, Ned, look, I'm your best friend,
all right, and I'll always have your back.

18
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,068
But there's only so much I can do
when you show up in a dress.

19
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,488
O'Donnell. How about you and
Boy George join us for this picture?

20
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,240
- Yep. Yep.
- Just one sec.

21
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,203
Give the little guy the sign, please.
Here we are.

22
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,038
Nice, guys. Scoot up in back.

23
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,082
Come on, you gotta look pretty
for the ladies, right? Come on.

24
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,377
Yeah. Let's do it. Three, two, one.

25
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,284
Hey, Vanilla Ice.

26
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,287
We got a game here. Let's bring it in.

27
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,624
Man, I had to. I had to.

28
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,376
Oh, man, over there.

29
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,756
Who is that stone-cold fox?

30
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,302
Oh, it's my girlfriend.

31
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,888
Take no prisoners, bro.

32
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,474
- Oh, hey, there's my girl.
- Hey.

33
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,645
I'm glad you're here, Scar. This whole
scout thing has me wicked nervous.

34
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,648
I just feel like my whole future's
riding on this game.

35
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,068
Yeah. Yeah, I know how you feel.

36
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,237
Yeah? Is eveï¿½ything...?
Everything's cool, right?

37
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,656
Oh, yeah.
Everything's totally copacetic.

38
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,408
- Totally?
- Totally.

39
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,160
O'Donnell.

40
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,746
I gotta go. See you.

41
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,172
You okay?

42
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,090
Uh, uh...

43
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,512
- We can talk about it later.
- No. Just tell me.

44
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,430
It's your big night. Go enjoy it.

45
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,433
I can't enjoy it unless you tell me
what's going on.

46
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,852
Okay.

47
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,896
Um...

48
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,001
O'Donnell!

49
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,399
Wake up!

50
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,733
O'Donnell!

51
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,320
What are you doing?

52
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,901
Scar! Scar, hey.

53
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,110
Hey, Scarlet.

54
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,822
- Hey, hey. Hey, what are you doing?
- Mike, what are you doing?

55
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,950
Look, you and me,
we're in this together, okay?

56
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,621
- But the game. That's your future.
- No, the baby's my future.

57
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,956
- That's crazy.
- You're my future.

58
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,210
I can't let you throw this all away.
I won't let you.

59
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,593
Thank you for letting me
stay here, Ned.

60
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,513
Oh, yeah. No problem.

61
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,518
- You good on the Cap'n?
- I'm good on the Captain.

62
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,190
Hey, Mike?

63
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,695
Mike, I can tell you're down,
but trust me on this.

64
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,531
You're looking at Scarlet
kicking you out of the house...

65
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:31,994
...and the kids wanting nothing to do
with you as a negative, when in fact...

66
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,041
- I guess it's mostly negative, isn't it?
- Well, yeah.

67
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,377
I had no upside for that.

68
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,547
Hey! You're getting that
big promotion today, right?

69
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,382
Yes. Yes, I am.

70
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,218
Today everything turns around for me.

71
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,179
Knock them dead.

72
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,098
I love you!

73
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,405
So anyway...

74
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,574
...the way corporate
wants us to spin it...

75
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,744
...is that maybe, in certain situations...

76
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,372
...a four-hour erection
isn't such a terrible thing.

77
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,584
Okay. Next up:

78
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:25,005
As most of you know, today I am proud to
be naming our new regional sales manager.

79
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,757
- Here we go.
- You know...

80
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:32,763
...l've been in the pharmaceutical game
for almost two years now...

81
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,225
...and people always ask me:
"What's it take to be an RSM?"

82
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,101
Leadership.

83
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,938
Courage.

84
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,440
Integrity.

85
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:48,403
But most importantly,
dedication to this company.

86
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,949
So congratulations. Mike.

87
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:57,287
Mike, if you could slide to your left so I
can congratulate our new RSM, Wendy!

88
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,581
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

89
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,294
Go out there and push some pills,
my peeps.

90
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,921
Good job, baby!

91
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,966
Bye-bye, thanks.

92
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,593
See you at practice. Mmm.

93
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:17,182
Mike. What's crack-a-lacking, coz?

94
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,602
Well, I'll tell you what's crack-a-lacking.
Are you kidding me?

95
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,481
Wendy's been here two months.
I've been here 16 years.

96
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,316
I got the best numbers on the team.

97
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,819
You should think of it as a compliment.

98
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:34,074
Think of it as us saying,
"You're just too valuable to promote."

99
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,827
- You little...
- Shh, shh, shh, hello?

100
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,997
Hey, buddy. No, no, no, I got time.

101
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:44,334
Ha. I know, right?
Look, listen, she was my doubles par...

102
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,926
So many girls and only one promotion,
but you guys are so supportive.

103
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,345
- But, Wendy, you did it.
- Thank you.

104
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,265
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

105
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,767
You guys! OMG.

106
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:05,022
Oh, and it gets better,
because we are going to T.G.I. Friday's!

107
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,648
- Shut up!
- Aah!

108
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:15,050
Mike O'Donnell.

109
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,096
Do I know you?

110
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,598
No. But I know you.

111
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,559
Oh, yeah?

112
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,896
High school star.
Never quite lived up to your potential.

113
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,484
Sooner or later you all come back
to the old school.

114
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:36,113
Stand there and look at the picture
of the glory days...

115
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,615
...wondering what might have been.

116
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,952
Seems to me you guys
are living in the past.

117
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,330
Well, of course I want to live in the past.

118
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,082
It was better there.

119
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,962
I'll bet you wish you had it
to do all over again.

120
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,007
Huh. You got that right.

121
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,136
You're sure about that?

122
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,014
Oh, yeah.

123
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,392
- Dad.
- Hi, Mr. O'Donnell.

124
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,061
- Ladies.
- What are you doing here?

125
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,147
Oh, I was just talking to...

126
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,482
...nobody.

127
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,487
Doesn't matter. I got off work early,
and I thought we could get ice cream.

128
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,032
Together?

129
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,827
- Why?
- Just go get your brother, okay?

130
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,164
Do you need anything else?

131
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,957
No, we're fine.

132
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:35,506
What's the matter?
This used to be your favorite place.

133
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,675
- We used to come here for your birthday.
- When I was, like, 8.

134
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,186
So, Al, basketball season's coming up.

135
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,395
- You ready?
- Yeah.

136
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,356
- Been working on that outside shot?
- Mm-hm.

137
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,649
- Passing?
- Good.

138
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,442
- Dribbling?
- Really good.

139
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,528
Good's not going to get you
a scholarship.

140
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,364
I meant, it's great.
It's great, Dad. It's great.

141
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,950
That's my boy. Remember,
it's not how big you are.

142
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,159
It's how big you play.

143
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,744
Right up here.

144
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,622
Uh, Maggie got into Georgetown.

145
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,124
Maggie, that's awesome.

146
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,710
Can you turn down the?

147
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,106
Okay, guys, see you soon.

148
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:40,070
Love you. Nice chatting with you.

149
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:56,587
What the hell are you doing?

150
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,174
Hey, that's my stuff.

151
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,888
Why are you destroying our yard?

152
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,098
It's not our yard. It's my yard, remember?

153
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:12,186
You took the road not taken.
And I get the yard.

154
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,026
I'm going to turn it into a showpiece
for my clients.

155
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,404
- Clients of what?
- Landscape design.

156
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,780
Landscape design?

157
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,283
I'm going to show people what I can do.

158
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:31,455
Yeah, well, the divorce isn't final for
another two weeks, so you have no right.

159
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,792
Really? So I've spent the last 18 years
of my life listening to you whine...

160
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,213
...about the things you could've done
without me, and I have no right?

161
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,591
- It's just I put a lot of work into this yard.
- Did you?

162
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,135
Really? Like the barbeque pit?

163
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,553
Yeah.

164
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,807
Yeah. The way I remember that is that
you spent about an hour working on it...

165
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,770
...and then you spent the next two days
complaining about...

166
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,981
...if you had gone to college,
you could've hired someone to do it.

167
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:01,401
- I don't think it was a whole two days.
- Or the hammock over here.

168
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,653
Yeah.

169
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,907
I think you quit that one because
you just decided not to try anymore.

170
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,701
Look, try to see things
from my point of view.

171
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,579
I am extremely disappointed with my life.

172
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,498
I never asked you to marry me.

173
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,999
Yeah, but I did.

174
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,046
Well...

175
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:25,467
...you don't have to do me
any more favors, then.

176
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,095
We're not going to hold each
other back anymore, okay?

177
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,807
- Scar...
- I'll see you at court, okay? At the trial.

178
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,308
Scarlet.

179
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,518
Naomi!

180
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,687
- You came.
- Of course I came.

181
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:40,232
What bridesmaid would I be if I
didn't hold your hand during the divorce?

182
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,111
Now, just remember.
The first one's always the hardest.

183
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,612
- Mike.
- Naomi.

184
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,155
- Naomi.
- I don't care.

185
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,450
Let's get going. We got to get you ready.
Back on the market.

186
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,827
Yeah, I'm a real catch.

187
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:56,039
Single mom with two teenage kids
and manure caked under my fingernails.

188
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,667
You'll do great. You got the butt
of a 12-year-old boy.

189
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,128
That's terrific.
I hope our daughter heard that.

190
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,839
Ugh. When was the last time you waxed?

191
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,678
Bye, Mike.

192
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,393
Bye.

193
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,384
You're sure about that?

194
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,271
Jesus.

195
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,411
Hey! Get off of there!

196
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,637
Oh, no. Hello?

197
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,182
Hello?! Hello?!

198
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,316
What the?

199
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,031
Oh, no!

200
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,663
Oh, man.

201
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,169
Ned?

202
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,712
Thief!

203
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,299
No, no, no, Ned!
Ned, no, no, no! It's me!

204
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,431
Stop! Stop!

205
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,438
Ned?

206
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,486
Oh, wow. I feel great.

207
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,072
Ha, ha.

208
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,493
What are you doing? No, Ned.

209
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,746
- Aah! Aah!
- No.

210
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,584
No, no, no, Ned!

211
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,389
Ned! Come on! It's me, it's Mike!

212
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,772
Ned, Ned, Ned, I'm telling you,
I'm telling you, stop it! Stop it! Now!

213
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,441
Oh.

214
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,277
An elegant weapon...

215
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,904
...from a more civilized time.

216
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:04,371
Hey, it's me! It's Mike O'Donnell,
your best friend!

217
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,958
You have an undescended testicle.

218
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,460
Googleable!

219
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,837
Ned!

220
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,799
You helped me cheat on my math test,
but I got caught.

221
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,051
Public record!

222
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,562
You asked Princess Leia
to junior prom.

223
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,148
Covered by the local news.

224
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,908
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

225
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,163
Please.

226
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,748
- Oh!
- Ha, ha!

227
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,627
Oh, my God.

228
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,922
No, no, no.

229
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,632
Ned, Ned.

230
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,593
Oh, my God.

231
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:14,316
Would you stop staring at me?

232
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,528
- It's freaking me out.
- It's freaking me out!

233
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,655
I'm pubescent!

234
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:26,537
Okay. So, uh...

235
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,539
...it's a classic transformation story.

236
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,750
It appears in the literature
time and time again.

237
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,253
Were you at any point shot
by a gamma ray?

238
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,090
- No.
- Exposed to gamma radiation of any kind?

239
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:40,175
- No, Ned.
- No?

240
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,553
You wouldn't see it. Okay.

241
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:46,932
That eliminates these and those
and most of that side.

242
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,187
Are you now or have you ever been...

243
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:56,316
...a Norse god, vampire,
or time-traveling cyborg?

244
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:59,403
I've known you since, what, first grade?
I would have told you.

245
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:03,156
Vampire wouldn't tell.
Cyborg wouldn't know.

246
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,825
Shut up.

247
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,080
Okay, if it's not any of those,
I guess, um, we're looking at your basic...

248
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:14,543
...spirit guide transformation magic.
That's kind of a biggie, actually.

249
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,462
That is here.

250
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,381
When the hero...

251
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:22,009
- I guess that's... I guess, you.
- Hm.

252
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:25,929
Uh, is transformed by his spirit guide...

253
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,764
...to set him on a new path.

254
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,601
- Which is what?
- Do I look like your spirit guide?

255
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,858
The janitor.

256
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,944
The janitor.

257
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:55,459
You guys seen the janitor?
You seen the janitor?

258
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:58,045
- Do you know where the janitor is?
- No.

259
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:01,298
Hey, where's the janitor?
Where does the janitor work?

260
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,467
- Excuse me!
- You all right, kid?

261
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,969
- There's another janitor who works here.
- Just me.

262
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,972
No, no. There's an older guy
with white hair who works here.

263
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:13,769
I was here yesterday talking to the janit...
I showed him this picture of me.

264
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:16,063
- You?
- Yeah.

265
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,982
That picture's from 1989.

266
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,820
Right. Forget it.

267
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,787
Alex!

268
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,330
Alex, buddy!

269
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,749
Alex!

270
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:11,994
Hello?

271
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,165
Spirit guide?

272
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,668
What am I supposed to do?

273
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,379
Don't know what I'm supposed to do.

274
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,181
Ouch. Oh, ow.

275
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,267
I got shot. Did I get shot or did I get...?
Someone got powned.

276
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,063
- It's a grenade.
- Ned.

277
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,149
Aah! Oh, sorry. Teenage you.

278
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:45,194
I figured it out.
I figured out what I'm supposed to do.

279
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,571
I figured out what my spirit guide
wants me to do.

280
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:48,989
I'm going back.

281
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,410
I'm going back to high school, Ned!

282
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:56,079
No! No, no. No way.

283
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,082
Your spirit guide would not waste
transformation magic...

284
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,919
...on you reliving your senior year
and going to prom. No.

285
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:07,007
Ned, this is my chance to have my life over,
but to do it right.

286
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,343
- Wouldn't you, if you had the chance?
- No.

287
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,095
I'm rich, and nobody stuck
my head in a toilet today.

288
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,014
Sure. Besides, it's not just about me.

289
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:18,268
- It's about you.
- No, it's much bigger than me.

290
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,562
- It's about you.
- Okay, maybe it's about me...

291
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,272
...but what's wrong with that?

292
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,400
I have not done anything
for me since 1989.

293
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:30,364
You do what you have to do. But don't
think about sucking me into this with you.

294
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,407
Hayden was the low point
of my existence...

295
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:36,870
...and I vowed I would never go back
to that godforsaken place!

296
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:40,290
Never, ever, ever!

297
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,710
Never! Never, ever, ever!

298
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,590
I hate you.

299
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,134
Hello.

300
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,304
I'm here to enroll my son...

301
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,431
...in school.

302
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,016
Mark.

303
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,143
What's up?

304
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,690
So...

305
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:10,487
So we'll just have a seat
till you're ready for us.

306
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,489
We'll be right, uh... Okay.

307
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,666
What's this you're wearing?

308
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:29,256
This is cool. This is hip. I have a picture
of Kevin Federline wearing the same thing.

309
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:31,675
- I don't know who that is.
- What are you wearing?

310
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,260
- I told you, like a dad.
- I am.

311
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:35,596
- You look like Clay Aiken.
- Leave him out of this.

312
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:42,227
- Are you sure these look legit?
- Oh, yeah. Look who you're talking to.

313
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:47,191
I'm the guy who invented the software
that prevents people from stealing music.

314
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,485
I also invented the software
that helps people steal music...

315
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,029
...but that's a happy coincidence.

316
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,491
What is that?

317
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,035
Oh, my G...

318
00:26:58,202 --> 00:26:59,953
- Wrong. These are for me.
- You kidding?

319
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,874
- What's-her-name and Chewie's for me.
- Miss Masterson will see you now.

320
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,125
Let's go.

321
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,545
Just don't try to be funny, all right?

322
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,797
Say as little as possible.

323
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,467
Hey, watch where you're going, toolbag.

324
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:17,095
- So sorry, sir. Our fault.
- Stan.

325
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:25,687
Hello. I'm Jane Masterson,
principal here at Hayden High.

326
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,397
Hi.

327
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,579
Hello.

328
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,915
- Hi.
- Hi.

329
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:46,917
Uh, okay.

330
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:49,878
Yeah, I think we're good here.

331
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,797
Sorry.

332
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,843
I think our hands just made a baby.

333
00:27:56,009 --> 00:28:00,722
Excuse my dad. He's not used to
talking to attractive women.

334
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:02,516
Oh, thank you...

335
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,560
- Mark.
- Mark...

336
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:08,397
...for that flattering
yet totally inappropriate comment.

337
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:09,773
Please sit.

338
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:15,946
Before we get started, I think you should
know that, uh, Mark's a bastard.

339
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,407
Excuse me?

340
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,576
I had him out of wedlock, so...

341
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,953
...l'm single.

342
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,454
And I'm very rich.

343
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,293
Okay.

344
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,962
- Did you bring your transcripts?
- Oh, yeah.

345
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,214
Transcripts.

346
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:38,051
Last school you went to was
Cutler High in Connecticut.

347
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:40,220
Straight-A student. Very impressive.

348
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,140
Math club...

349
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:45,642
...National Merit finalist...

350
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,896
...Coney Island
Hot Dog Eating Champion.

351
00:28:53,984 --> 00:28:56,987
Well, I think Hayden
would be lucky to have you.

352
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,115
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

353
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,832
Uh, yes, Mr. Gold.
Do you have a question?

354
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,835
Your hair is pretty.

355
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:16,089
Ah. Not a question, but thank you.

356
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:19,760
Would the lady mind if I smelled it?

357
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:23,514
Now is probably a good time to tell you
that I don't date students' parents.

358
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:29,019
Well, maybe I should tell you that I never
don't not date the principal of my child.

359
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,980
Okay, come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

360
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,233
Let's go.

361
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:36,985
I was about to close!

362
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,364
You have to do it right now?
Just calm down. You're a dad.

363
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:44,159
- Hi. Oh, my gosh. We're in.
- You see her undress me with her eyes?

364
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:46,161
I don't think that's what that was.

365
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:49,456
Hey. Wow. I don't know how we did it.

366
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:51,250
It's Maggie's friends. Watch this.

367
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,961
- Hey, girls, how's it going?
- Do I know you?

368
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,420
What'd you do, mug K-Fed?

369
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,386
Welcome to the bottom
of the food chain.

370
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:07,975
Hey, look, you always had
my back in high school, okay?

371
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,894
So if your spirit guide
wants you to be a fake teenager...

372
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,021
...and me to be your fake dad...

373
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:16,358
...the least I can do is make sure
that my fake son doesn't look...

374
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:19,027
...like a total douche.

375
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,239
- I don't look like a douche.
- What a douche.

376
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,449
We're going shopping.

377
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:27,244
- Really?
- Yes, your shirt is bedazzled.

378
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,746
Bedazzled with rhinestones.

379
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,101
Ooh.

380
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,103
Let's go to school.

381
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,438
Hey, yo, check it out.

382
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,106
That's just rude.

383
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,192
What's up, dude?

384
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,699
What are you looking at, punk?

385
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:51,161
- Watch it.
- Wake up, douche.

386
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:55,749
Sorry.

387
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:01,171
No phones, no texting.

388
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:05,592
Settle, people. Settle down.

389
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,428
Take the roughhousing outside, class.

390
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:14,643
Hello?

391
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:17,938
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you?

392
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,525
Oh, cr...

393
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:24,695
- The thing.
- You mean our divorce?

394
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,613
Do you take any of this seriously?

395
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,825
No, no! Yes, I take this seriously.

396
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:33,620
I had to leave the country
very suddenly, uh...

397
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:36,540
...with the Mayan... Inca,
I'm with the Incas in Peru.

398
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:38,667
We think we might have found the next...

399
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:41,044
...Rogaine.

400
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:44,381
Are you with a girl?

401
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,384
No, no. It's, uh, a bunch of cheerleaders.

402
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:51,013
So would you consider
maybe dating a 10th-grader?

403
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,056
I think we could go for full custody.

404
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,309
No, you can't take my kids
away from me.

405
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,561
Since when do you care?

406
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,317
Look...

407
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:07,696
...l'm a lot closer to them than you think.

408
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,240
Let's reschedule, okay?

409
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:14,286
Hey, Maggie.

410
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,083
Um, why is the new kid waving at me?

411
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,002
I don't know.

412
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,171
But if that boy were an apple...

413
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:25,797
...he'd be a Delicious.

414
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,091
Oh, God.

415
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:35,516
Gosh, we are all in such great shape.

416
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:37,267
Oh, jeez.

417
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:40,521
Man, you know, I will tell you something.

418
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,607
In 10 years you're going
to have this thing right here...

419
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:48,403
...that no amount of crunches will
get rid of. And spot reduction, total lie.

420
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,447
You know, l...

421
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,575
Never mind. Give me the ball.

422
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:55,786
Fakes right, goes left.

423
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:57,913
And signature move.

424
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:00,791
Kid.

425
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:06,922
- I'm Coach Murphy.
- Oh, wow.

426
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:09,633
- You're still here?
- What?

427
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,094
You're a legend.

428
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:15,514
Yeah. Well, yeah. Twenty years.

429
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:18,183
It's actually my last one.

430
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,103
Good hops, kid. Nice handle.

431
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,230
We're looking for a point guard.

432
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:24,815
Oh, yeah?

433
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:30,154
- Why don't you come to tryouts?
- Okay.

434
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:33,574
- I'm done talking to you.
- Yeah, yeah.

435
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:37,619
Hey, how's it going?

436
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:38,829
Things are looking up.

437
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:41,832
Coach Murphy practically
put me on the team.

438
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,585
That's not a coincidence.
We're on the path.

439
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:48,005
That's great. That's super you're finding
your destiny and, blah, blah, whatever.

440
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,591
Here's something.
I need you to do something for me.

441
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,342
I need you to get in trouble.

442
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:53,969
Not, like, big trouble.

443
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:57,806
Just enough trouble so that the principal
needs to meet with your father.

444
00:34:57,973 --> 00:34:59,600
Yeah, okay, well, we'll see.

445
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,810
- Oh! Boom.
- Ned!

446
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:03,103
Boom. Checkmate, Samir!

447
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,105
- Damn it!
- Checkmate.

448
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:08,609
Uh, can I get a little help in here?

449
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:12,613
Alex?

450
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:20,871
How does it...?

451
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:25,167
- Who did this to you?
- The basketball team.

452
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:29,713
But why? Why? You're one of them.

453
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,131
You're popular.

454
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:35,969
Uh, look, this is kind of personal,
and I don't know you.

455
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:37,346
- I'm taped to the toilet.
- Yeah.

456
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:42,059
I'm sorry, I'm Mark Gold, uh,
your uncle Ned's kid. I just started here.

457
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,311
Oh, cool. Cool, yeah.

458
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:46,688
Well, I'd shake your hand...

459
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:48,982
...but it's taped to my ass.
- Right. Right.

460
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:50,359
Would you mind?

461
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:53,237
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Yeah, um.

462
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,572
- Just rip.
- I'm going to get it.

463
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:57,866
- Band-Aid.
- Go for it.

464
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:03,914
So how come we never met?

465
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,919
My mom didn't want anyone to know
she had a kid with Ned.

466
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,171
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

467
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,258
So since we're practically
family and all...

468
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:17,928
...my dad says we should just
keep an eye on each other, you know?

469
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:19,555
Uh, yeah. Why not?

470
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:22,766
Next time you could get there
before they tape me to the toilet.

471
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,476
You got it.

472
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:28,397
This looks good.

473
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:35,487
Who's that?

474
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:36,947
Oh, uh...

475
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:38,782
- Nicole.
- Are you two going out?

476
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:41,493
No, no, she's the, uh, head cheerleader.

477
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:43,453
She'd never go out with me.

478
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,456
You know, when I first met
your mother, I was so nervous...

479
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,125
You met my mother?

480
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,543
- What?
- My mother.

481
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,421
You said, "The first time I met
your mother, I was nervous."

482
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:55,716
- Oh, that's weird. Is your mom hot?
- Dude, what...?

483
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:59,803
- What do I say to that?
- I was joking. Joking, dude.

484
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,975
Stan.

485
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,146
I hate that guy.

486
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,982
- Oh.
- Thanks.

487
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:13,192
- What?
- Huh.

488
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:15,527
- Freshman.
- Good sandwich.

489
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,156
Is that the guy
who taped you to the toilet?

490
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,532
Yeah.

491
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:23,744
Yesterday he shoved me in a
washing machine in my own house.

492
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:27,331
- What was that jerk doing at your house?
- It's Maggie's boyfriend.

493
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,667
Maggie has a boyfriend?

494
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,505
Well...

495
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:37,508
...l'm very disappointed in your sister.

496
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:41,929
He's looking. Don't make eye contact.
He's kind of temperamental.

497
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:45,349
- You're looking. Stop it, stop it.
- I'll look at him.

498
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:47,392
Hey, twinkle douche.

499
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:53,273
If I wanted you in the cafeteria,
I would've taped you to a lunch lady.

500
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:56,276
You little punk.

501
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:58,695
You don't talk to him that way.

502
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:02,991
Yeah?

503
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:05,869
What are you gonna do?

504
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,000
What am I gonna do?

505
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:15,671
First...

506
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,674
...l'm going to call your father.

507
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,804
Heads up!

508
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:35,232
Give me my ball back, bitch.

509
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,734
You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you.

510
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,904
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

511
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,739
All too well.

512
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:44,783
You're the man.

513
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,077
Captain of the basketball team.

514
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:49,496
Dates the pretty girls.

515
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,833
High school is your kingdom.

516
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,711
But, people...

517
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:57,963
...Stan's a bully.

518
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,590
Why?

519
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:05,721
It'd be way too easy to say Stan preys
on the weak simply because he's a dick.

520
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:07,097
No.

521
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,433
No, no.

522
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,268
Stan here...

523
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,271
...is much more complex than that.

524
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,441
See, according to leading psychiatrists...

525
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,903
...Stan's a bully for one of three reasons.

526
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:23,030
One:

527
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,741
Underneath all of that male bravado...

528
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:29,786
...there's an insecure little girl banging
on the closet door trying to get out.

529
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,458
Two:

530
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,376
Like a caveman...

531
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,712
...Stan's brain is...

532
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:41,256
...underdeveloped.

533
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:44,468
Therefore, Stan is unable
to use self-control.

534
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:46,803
And so he acts out aggressively.

535
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,973
And the third reason:

536
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:52,434
Stan has a small wiener.

537
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:14,039
Don't hurt yourself, big boy.

538
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:26,927
Whoa, whoa, hey. Drinking age is still 21,
thank you very much.

539
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:30,931
Unless your spirit guide gave you
a fake ID, this is mine.

540
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:36,478
What are you eating?

541
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:39,398
I don't even know.
I just know I'm hungry.

542
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:41,024
All the time.

543
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:42,901
Okay, that's not safe or sanitary.

544
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,821
That's your can now.
We'll label it like that.

545
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,201
So, what did you learn at school today?

546
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:56,206
- That I'm a bad dad.
- I thought it was going great.

547
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:59,209
It was going fantastic for me.

548
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,794
And then what?

549
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:07,176
And then I found out my son spent the
last year being the school punching bag...

550
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:11,096
...and watched my daughter get a
tongue bath from a psychopathic jackass.

551
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:13,140
High school's delightful, isn't it?

552
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:16,685
Yeah. But I think I was wrong
about my spirit path.

553
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:18,979
And who was right? See? I told you.

554
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:21,148
I told you high school
was the wrong thing.

555
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:25,027
High school was right,
but it's not about basketball.

556
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:27,738
It's about helping Alex and Maggie.

557
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,283
Mmm.

558
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:34,495
All right. I'm getting out of here.

559
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,748
- Disgusting.
- My kids need their father.

560
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:47,257
- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, Mark.

561
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:51,595
What was that?

562
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,515
A three-pointer.

563
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,393
Can you do that twice in a row?

564
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:05,859
Okay. Let's see you do it
with a little pressure.

565
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,410
Wow, you're great.
You should be on the team.

566
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:20,749
You should be on the team.
I'm going to get you on the team.

567
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:24,753
That's it. That'll solve everything.

568
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:27,130
Dude, what are you talking about?

569
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:28,632
Nothing.

570
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:39,726
Well, that was fun. I haven't been to
happy hour in, like, a week and a half.

571
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,063
Naomi, thank you so much.
That is exactly what I needed.

572
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,773
Oh, great.

573
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,484
- Mike who?
- Mike who? I've never heard of the guy.

574
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:48,944
Ow.

575
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:52,906
Hey, Mom, this is Mark,
Uncle Ned's bastard.

576
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:54,366
Wow.

577
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:57,661
I know. Someone had a kid
with Uncle Ned. Ew.

578
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:01,331
You okay, Mrs. O'Donnell?

579
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:03,167
Yeah, I'm fine.

580
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:06,211
It's "Ms.," kid. It's "Ms.," Scarlet.
Don't forget that.

581
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:07,629
Oh, right.

582
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:13,260
Wow.

583
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:18,265
You look just like my husband.
Doesn't he?

584
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:21,727
- My ex-husband. That is so weird.
- Heh, heh.

585
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:23,020
It is weird.

586
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:24,855
What is that?

587
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:26,481
Scarlet, I need you to come.

588
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:27,858
Weird.

589
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:29,526
- Do you see that?
- I did see it.

590
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:32,029
- You see him?
- She's nice.

591
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:33,447
But look at him.

592
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:36,783
You gotta let that guy go,
just out of your brain and move on.

593
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,953
I know you need to grieve
a relationship. It's only natural.

594
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,371
Okay.

595
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:44,124
You wait here.
I'm going to go smell him.

596
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,628
No, no, no. Sweetie.
You're not allowed to smell teenagers.

597
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:51,048
Sweetie, you need to hear me on this.
Here's the thing.

598
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:53,091
The other thing,
you need to acknowledge...

599
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:56,553
...that he looks exactly like Mike
used to look in high school.

600
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,474
We discussed that. I have looked at him.
But, honey, this is the thing:

601
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,726
You need to hook up with someone new.

602
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:07,731
Yeah, I deserve to have somebody
smile at me and tell me I'm pretty.

603
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:09,566
- You do.
- Even if it is...

604
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:12,152
...to just get me to go home with him.

605
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:17,199
Or lunch. But, yes, we're gonna
find you a new playmate. Ow!

606
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:19,827
You little turd. You little snot.

607
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,495
My bad. Gosh, I'm so sorry.

608
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:25,749
I guess I was, uh, kind of distracted,
as I imagine Alex was...

609
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:29,211
...at hearing about how his mother,
who is still married, by the way...

610
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:31,880
...is planning to run around
with every guy she can get.

611
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:35,843
In Afghanistan, she'd be dragged through
the streets by goats with her hands cut off.

612
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:37,928
I'm just saying. I'm just saying, Naomi.

613
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:40,389
- Naomi.
- I don't care.

614
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,656
- Hey, guys.
- Oh.

615
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,783
Okay, settle down. Take your seats.

616
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,620
Thank you, thank you. Thank you, Stan.
Thank you.

617
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:09,459
Okay, today we will be continuing
our discussion on human sexuality.

618
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:14,590
And as we discussed,
the official school policy is abstinence.

619
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,466
Now, that is very sensible.

620
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:19,595
I'm glad that someone here
has their head screwed on straight.

621
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:23,390
I think all of us should make a pact
to abstain from sex.

622
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:25,809
Now, who's with me, you guys?
Come on.

623
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:28,228
Oh, my God.

624
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,900
- Maggie?
- Hm?

625
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:35,277
However, let's get real.

626
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:38,739
I know asking high school seniors
to be abstinent...

627
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:42,826
...is like asking a porcupine
to poop goat cheese. Yuck.

628
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:47,498
So since the majority of you are or will
become sexually active at some point...

629
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:52,461
But that point should be way,
way in the future, right?

630
00:45:52,628 --> 00:45:55,130
Well, the official school position...

631
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:57,508
...is that we prepare you
for safe sex now.

632
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:01,678
So please take one and pass it down.

633
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:09,353
I have needs.

634
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:14,775
- You don't need these.
- Stan, give one to Mark.

635
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:19,112
No. No, you know what, he's right.
He's right. I don't need one.

636
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:23,033
You know why I don't need one?
Because there's no one I'm in love with.

637
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,244
It's called "making love," isn't it?

638
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:30,791
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I think that
means you do it with someone you love.

639
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,377
And preferably when you're married.

640
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:38,298
You know, when you're ready to take
that love and turn it into a baby.

641
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:41,760
Because that's what love is.

642
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:45,055
It's that first moment
when you hold your baby girl...

643
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:50,894
...and you didn't know that anything
could be so small or so delicate.

644
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:53,981
And you feel that tiny heart beat...

645
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:58,694
...and you know that you couldn't love
anything more in the whole world.

646
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:03,240
And you hope that you can do right
by that little girl...

647
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:08,162
...and always be there to catch her when
she falls, and that nothing ever hurts her.

648
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,873
Not a broken arm...

649
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,250
...or a bad dream...

650
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:17,754
...or a broken heart.

651
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:26,346
- I don't want these. Just take them.
- Me either.

652
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:27,890
Are you serious?

653
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:30,809
Great, fine, wonderful.

654
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:32,686
More for me.

655
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:35,772
Now I got enough
for the whole weekend.

656
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:40,027
Oh, my God!

657
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:43,989
- Stan!
- Boys, stop it!

658
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:45,908
Break it up! Get off him, Stan!

659
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:49,703
Put those phones away! Stop it!

660
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:52,372
- Stop hitting him!
- No fighting!

661
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,376
- You like that?
- You're gonna go to jail again.

662
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:02,633
Look at that.
He slapped him like a mother.

663
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:04,259
That thing sucks.

664
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:08,305
- Oh!
- Oh, that's wrong.

665
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,017
Yo, check this out.
My cousin in New York sent it to me.

666
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:25,531
I hope I'm not late for our meeting.

667
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:28,826
Busted for fighting, nice. Who won?

668
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:31,995
You know, it was actually pretty even.

669
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:33,664
Really?

670
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:36,166
On YouTube it looked like
you got your ass kicked.

671
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,210
I saw it a couple times.

672
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:41,046
- What are you wearing?
- Hm?

673
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,549
- Beckham.
- No, what?

674
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:45,259
Oh, the clothes. Oh, right.

675
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:47,761
To the untrained eye,
I look like a total idiot.

676
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:49,263
You do, in fact.

677
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:53,934
Ah. But it's actually a seduction
technique known as "peacocking."

678
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:58,355
My outfit serves the dual function
of icebreaker and attention-getter.

679
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:01,275
You can go in now.

680
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:03,360
Watch.

681
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,535
Are you peacocking?

682
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:14,371
Really? You think that's gonna work?

683
00:49:14,538 --> 00:49:15,998
I think it just might.

684
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:29,761
Is that? Mrs. O'Donnell!
How you doing?

685
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:31,096
Hello, how are you?

686
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:32,681
I'm good. How are you?

687
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:34,433
Good.

688
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:38,270
Wow. This is gonna take
some getting used to.

689
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:40,189
You're Ned's son?

690
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:42,608
Yeah. Yeah. Ned gave birth to me.

691
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:45,569
Well, he didn't give birth...
You know what I meant.

692
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:49,406
You're doing some gardening.

693
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:52,034
- I'm redoing the backyard.
- Oh.

694
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:53,327
You want to see?

695
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:56,330
Yeah, sure. I got some time.

696
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:00,250
Oh, wow.

697
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:04,755
Yeah. Obviously, I still have a lot to do.

698
00:50:04,922 --> 00:50:07,049
- You can put that...
- Right here?

699
00:50:07,216 --> 00:50:08,509
All right.

700
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:10,844
Thank you.

701
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:13,013
- So this is it.
- This is it.

702
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,598
It used to look a lot worse.

703
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:17,643
Mm-mm.

704
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:23,357
Basically, uh, what I planned to do was
to put a pond in over here...

705
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:26,068
- Okay.
...and have water...

706
00:50:26,235 --> 00:50:28,821
...streaming in from both sides.

707
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:33,075
And then put a big deck right here...

708
00:50:33,242 --> 00:50:38,956
...and then a flagstone patio there
with sod in between.

709
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:40,541
That would be pretty.

710
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:45,963
And then to have twinkling lights
above the whole thing...

711
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:48,632
...so that every night is a starry one.

712
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,133
Heh.

713
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,636
It's gonna be amazing, Scar.

714
00:50:52,803 --> 00:50:54,054
What did you just call me?

715
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:56,056
Uh...

716
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,809
- I just said, "lt'll be amazing."
- You called me "Scar."

717
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:01,687
My husband's the only one
who calls me that.

718
00:51:01,854 --> 00:51:03,397
Could you use some help?

719
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:07,401
Volunteer. I'm young, I'm strong.

720
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:09,194
Oh. Oh.

721
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:11,488
Right, got it. Okay.

722
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:17,578
I realize that whole
lady cougar hunting...

723
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:22,166
...the "mothers I'd like to,"
you know, whatever, thing...

724
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:25,669
...is big with you guys, right?
With you high school boys?

725
00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:28,422
But that's not gonna happen
between me and you.

726
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:30,966
I didn't even mean it that way.

727
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:36,180
I was thinking more along the lines of
business experience, college application.

728
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:38,807
But if you want to go there, that's...

729
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:40,976
- So I'll just get you a shovel, then?
- Yeah.

730
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:42,352
Okay.

731
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:31,819
What?

732
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:13,443
- I said we could do it!
- Called it.

733
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,737
Did you see the look on Stan's face?

734
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:21,243
Alex? What happened at the tryouts?
How'd it go?

735
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:25,539
It was good. Mark had a great tryout.
He played great.

736
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:28,208
- Yeah.
- And so did I. I made the team.

737
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,211
Really? Oh, great! That's so good.
I'm so proud of you.

738
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:32,629
Me too.

739
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:34,298
He did great out there.

740
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:36,383
Oh, Mark. That's super inappropriate.

741
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,468
L... Good job today.

742
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:39,928
- Good job!
- Thanks.

743
00:53:40,095 --> 00:53:43,265
I want to show you something.
Come here. I wanna show you guys.

744
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:48,312
Ta-da.

745
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,732
- You hung the lights.
- Yes.

746
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:53,817
- Wow.
- Wow.

747
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:56,236
I wanted you guys to be the first to see.

748
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:58,071
- Mom, it's sick.
- Really?

749
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:00,240
It's so good.

750
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:02,701
Oh, my gosh.

751
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:07,498
Mark. Mark, we should go practice, dude.

752
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:10,250
The game's on Friday.
Mom, such a good job.

753
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:16,924
What do you think?

754
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,467
It's amazing.

755
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:23,347
When people see how talented you are,
you'll be designing gardens all over the city.

756
00:54:23,514 --> 00:54:24,848
Really?

757
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:26,683
Well, thank you, Mark. That's nice.

758
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:32,356
Oh.

759
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:37,027
- I have to go. I have a date tonight.
- You have a...? You have a date?

760
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:40,823
I'm going dancing, which is ridiculous
because I'm a terrible dancer.

761
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:44,326
- You're an amazing dancer.
- What?

762
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:47,371
- Hm? Ahem.
- Wh...?

763
00:54:47,538 --> 00:54:49,289
You just look like you can move.

764
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:51,208
Um, okay.

765
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:54,878
I'm going to go, so have fun, Mark.

766
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:56,547
Night.

767
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:15,941
- What are you looking at?
- That was great.

768
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:18,735
That is The Snake.

769
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:21,488
That was a very hot dance
when you were 1.

770
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:24,825
- Teach it to me.
- I can't.

771
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:27,119
It's a very advanced step...

772
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:30,831
...which I know is hard to believe
because I make it look effortless.

773
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:33,667
That's the secret to all great dancers.

774
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:36,211
Try me.

775
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:41,216
Why did you pick that song?

776
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:44,845
Oh, I don't know.
It just, uh, kind of spoke to me.

777
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:47,014
Hm. That's funny.

778
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:50,100
That's the song that my husband
and I danced to at our wedding.

779
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:52,394
Hm. A man of good taste.

780
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:54,646
- Want me to show you some dance moves?
- I'd love to.

781
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:56,106
That I learned at my wedding.

782
00:55:56,273 --> 00:56:00,652
- Great.
- Yeah. Okay, you stand here, like that.

783
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:03,280
Okay, like that, and I'll stand here.

784
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,450
- No, you stand right there.
- Right there.

785
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:10,996
Okay, ready? So you go
right foot back and then left foot back.

786
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:15,125
And then quick
right, left, right, left, right.

787
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:17,961
And then right... Oh.

788
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:21,048
That was good.
And left, right, left, right.

789
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:23,091
That's good.

790
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:26,220
That was really good.
You're picking that up pretty quickly.

791
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:28,347
- So you mentioned your husband.
- Mm-hm.

792
00:56:28,514 --> 00:56:30,807
Do you think you guys are ever
going to get back together?

793
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:33,143
Um, no.

794
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,646
Why are you so sure?

795
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:39,024
Maybe there's something he could do
to fix things.

796
00:56:39,191 --> 00:56:42,361
I love my husband and care about him...

797
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:46,573
...but sometimes that just is not enough.

798
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,744
Well, he blew it.

799
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,287
Jump.

800
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:09,680
- Mom?
- Yeah.

801
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:13,600
Hey, Alex.

802
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,646
- Mom?
- I'm your mom.

803
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:19,815
I am Alex's mom, Mark.

804
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:21,275
Yeah.

805
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:24,695
- Your date is here.
- Huh?

806
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,364
- The front door. Your date.
- Okay.

807
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:29,867
She was nervous. It's creepy, right?

808
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:31,618
Little bit.

809
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:34,037
She's so old, it's like...

810
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:36,874
Dance with all your friend's moms?

811
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,375
Pretty much.

812
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:40,627
- Oh, hi, Scarlet.
- Hello.

813
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:43,297
- Wow, you look amazing. Here. Pour vous.
- Oh, thank you.

814
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:46,049
Carnations. What a douche bag.

815
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:47,467
Mark.

816
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:49,553
- No, that's okay.
- I'm sorry.

817
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,762
I'm a single dad.

818
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:54,558
It's totally normal for sons to
feel weird when their moms date.

819
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:58,020
I mean, he's stepping into
Dad's shoes, protecting the castle.

820
00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:00,230
- He's not my son, but...
- Oh.

821
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:02,274
Then that's weird.

822
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:03,692
- It is.
- Yeah.

823
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:05,819
- Uh, do you want to go?
- Yeah.

824
00:58:06,278 --> 00:58:07,404
Let me get my coat.

825
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,406
- Oh, come on.
- Hold these, please.

826
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:10,908
- This guy?
- You're being rude.

827
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:12,910
- You're going from Uncle Mike to this guy?
- Shh.

828
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:15,496
- Be quiet.
- Okay.

829
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:18,499
- Do me a favor. Shh.
- He's a tool.

830
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:22,336
Give this to Ned, okay, to give to Mike.
It's our divorce papers.

831
00:58:22,503 --> 00:58:25,756
And remind him that he needs
to be there on the 27th.

832
00:58:25,923 --> 00:58:28,258
Okay? Thank you.

833
00:58:53,492 --> 00:58:54,660
Where are you going?

834
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:56,620
Jamie's party.

835
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,416
Alex!

836
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:07,130
Yeah, uh, seriously, I can't be here.
I really can't be here.

837
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:10,759
Do you know how many dangerous and
hurtful things Stan could do to me here?

838
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:13,804
You had your head shoved in a
ball return? It's not a massage.

839
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:16,723
You're on the basketball team now.
Okay? This is your party.

840
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:19,059
Okay, okay, there she is.

841
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:20,602
There's Nicole. Oh, God.

842
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:22,437
- Which one?
- She's right there.

843
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:24,439
You're looking at... She's my 3, your 2.

844
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,608
- Stop it. You're looking right at her.
- Calm down.

845
00:59:28,152 --> 00:59:29,653
- Sorry.
- What was that?

846
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,989
- Nothing, it was a burp.
- Why are you burping?

847
00:59:32,156 --> 00:59:34,658
- I have tummy issues. What? Get over it.
- Tummy issues?

848
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:36,910
She's not going to like me. I'm a loser.

849
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:40,122
Why are you a loser?
Because Stan says you're a loser?

850
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:43,167
Do you think Stan's a winner?
Stan's going nowhere.

851
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:46,753
Any girl in here would be lucky
to have your attention.

852
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,340
- What do you know about girls?
- What do I know about girls?

853
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:53,468
I used to date the
most beautiful girl in school...

854
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:55,554
...and I let her slip through my fingers.

855
00:59:56,013 --> 00:59:57,681
But I won't let that happen to you.

856
00:59:58,182 --> 00:59:59,433
You're absolutely right.

857
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,269
I'm just going to walk up to her
and introduce myself.

858
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:05,689
Tomorrow at school. Maybe.
Probably not.

859
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:07,399
Just go.

860
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,947
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, you came.

861
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,282
- How are you?
- Good.

862
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:18,035
Thank you, um. Have you seen Maggie?
I've been looking everywhere.

863
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:20,704
Oh, um, Maggie's not here.

864
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:22,706
But, um, I am.

865
01:00:22,873 --> 01:00:25,501
And I'm really, really glad you came.

866
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:29,838
- It's her birthday.
- I didn't get you a present, I'm sorry.

867
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:32,841
- I'll just have to unwrap you.
- Heh, heh. Okay.

868
01:00:34,051 --> 01:00:38,639
I was kicked off the cheerleading squad
for being too flexible.

869
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:46,188
Okay, okay. Sit down. Just sit down.

870
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:51,401
If you girls don't respect yourselves...

871
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:55,280
...then how do you expect
anyone else to respect you?

872
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:56,698
Right?

873
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:57,908
Don't respect me.

874
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,368
No, don't respect me.

875
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:01,662
You don't even have to
remember my name.

876
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:03,914
- Wow, that's slutty.
- First of all, you slut.

877
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:06,333
This is some other dad's problem.

878
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:11,046
And, um, I just want to tell you
that you look like my dog.

879
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:15,717
- Excuse me?
- Your hair looks like my dog's hair.

880
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:18,262
- Oh, um...
- No, it's shiny and soft.

881
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:20,722
We give my dog special food.
It's got flax in it.

882
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:22,766
Oh, flax.

883
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:24,601
- She's a sweetheart.
- That's sweet.

884
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:26,186
Well, she died.

885
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,314
So I look like your dead dog?

886
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:32,609
I'm just really nervous, and I've wanted
to talk to you for so long.

887
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:35,112
- What am I thinking?
- Don't worry about it. Really.

888
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:37,573
- Alex?
- Oh, my God, you know my name.

889
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:38,907
You're on fire.

890
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:42,119
- Really?
- Literally, you're on fire.

891
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:43,370
What?

892
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:45,038
Literally on fire.

893
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:48,959
Whoa. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna
get out of here. Later.

894
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:56,258
Just hand me those keys right there.

895
01:01:56,425 --> 01:01:57,551
They're in for the night.

896
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:03,765
If the keys are locked in there, I don't
know how I'm going to get you guys out.

897
01:02:04,475 --> 01:02:07,269
Conserve some oxygen in there.

898
01:02:07,436 --> 01:02:10,481
Don't scream, you have
a limited amount of oxygen.

899
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,401
They're pretty, huh?
We got some pretty ladies in here.

900
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:17,613
Oh, there you are.

901
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:35,130
- What do you want?
- I just want to talk about Stan.

902
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:36,715
Yeah?

903
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:41,595
Why are you dating him?
I mean, you know he is not a nice guy.

904
01:02:41,762 --> 01:02:43,138
He's crazy.

905
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:46,016
Hey, don't say that about Stan.
You don't even know him.

906
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:49,686
Oh, but I do. I really do.
I know him better than you.

907
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:52,356
Look, we're moving in together
after graduation.

908
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:54,316
Stan got into Georgetown?

909
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,735
- What?
- What?

910
01:02:56,902 --> 01:03:01,156
No. No. Stan got on the management track
at Home Depot.

911
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:02,950
Oh, great.

912
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:06,995
And I'm going to Westwood Community
College to be closer to him.

913
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:09,540
He's my forever.

914
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:15,003
- There's no way in hell that's happening.
- Excuse me?

915
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:18,340
I said, "There's no way in hell
that that is happening."

916
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:21,927
You think I'm gonna let you mortgage
your future?

917
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:24,471
You think I'll let you throw away
your hard work...

918
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,849
...everything that you've accomplished...

919
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:29,560
...for some psychopathic guy
who doesn't care about you?

920
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:33,355
I forbid you. I forbid you
to see him anymore.

921
01:03:33,522 --> 01:03:38,652
Oh, okay! Who the hell do you think
you are, my father?! Dude!

922
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:41,155
- Don't walk away from me.
- You're a freak.

923
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:42,823
Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!

924
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:47,870
- Hey. How'd it go?
- Fantastic.

925
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:50,581
What's on your leg?

926
01:03:51,248 --> 01:03:53,458
We're the Warriors! Yeah, yeah!

927
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:55,794
Remember: Defense wins the game.

928
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:58,839
What's wrong? You look uncomfortable.

929
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:01,091
Oh. No.

930
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:05,637
I was just thinking that
the last time I was here...

931
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:08,140
...my husband asked me to marry him.

932
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:10,017
Wow.

933
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,352
Tough to compete with that.

934
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:17,149
Down by 6, get the ball to Gold.

935
01:04:17,316 --> 01:04:19,943
Warriors on three. One, two, three.

936
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,612
Warriors!

937
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,369
Stan, what are you doing? Let's go.

938
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:32,581
Go, Alex! Whoo!

939
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:33,916
Woo-hoo.

940
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:41,632
Left side.

941
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,065
Pick off! Right there!

942
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:02,820
He's got too much time. Come on!

943
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,244
Yeah!

944
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:15,666
Get it to McKinley! Get it in! Get it!

945
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,334
Get him!

946
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:24,341
Ball!

947
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:26,176
Come on, outside!

948
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:30,973
O'Donnell! Give the ball to Gold!
Give the ball to Gold!

949
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,350
No, no, no!

950
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:49,116
We did it! You were great. Oh.
Ooh. I, um...

951
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,743
- I'm sweaty. Um...
- Sorry about that.

952
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,662
Congratula... That was awesome.

953
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:56,665
You did a great...
I saw the... I liked the dance.

954
01:05:57,207 --> 01:06:01,003
Yeah, so I think August...
August will be good.

955
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:03,881
All right, uh, have a good night.

956
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:05,382
See you tomorrow.

957
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:18,061
Oh. Hi. Wow, what are the odds?

958
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:21,356
What's it going to be now?
Did you buy me the Statue of Liberty?

959
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:24,943
I'm just going to ask you out, okay?
Like a grownup.

960
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,612
Just two fï¿½iends having dinner.

961
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:32,034
Then if it turns into anything else,
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

962
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:34,912
No. Good night.

963
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:37,706
I'll buy every student a laptop.

964
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:43,045
You would deny the children of laptops?

965
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:46,089
- Miss Masterson, the children.
- Okay. Okay, fine, fine.

966
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:49,426
Fine. But this is not a date.

967
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:50,761
No, in no way a date.

968
01:06:50,928 --> 01:06:54,598
And if I do this, you will stop
the inappropriate behavior and gifts.

969
01:06:54,765 --> 01:06:57,851
- Yes.
- And we'll just drive to this restaurant.

970
01:06:58,018 --> 01:07:00,187
We won't fly there in the space shuttle...

971
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:03,941
...or drive in some gaudy, tacky limo.

972
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:06,276
No, let's take your car. How about?

973
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,573
This way.

974
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:15,869
Ned to driver, abort.
Abort, abort. Move it out right now.

975
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:22,417
I totally missed it. She came right up to me,
I should've kissed her. And I froze.

976
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:25,128
Hey, don't worry.
I'll get you another chance.

977
01:07:25,295 --> 01:07:26,880
How? How are you going to do that?

978
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:34,471
Victory party at my house!

979
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:49,903
Maggie.

980
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:02,833
Maggie? Hey, Maggie.

981
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,459
Go away.

982
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:07,045
Hey, what happened?

983
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:09,381
What do you want?

984
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:12,176
Rub it in my face? Say, "I told you so"?

985
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:14,928
No. No, I really don't.

986
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,140
Just tell me what happened.

987
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:23,687
Stan dumped me.

988
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,110
Stan dumped you?

989
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:32,070
Stan dumped you? What?

990
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,866
What happened? How did this...?
What did he do?

991
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:37,618
What did he do?

992
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:40,037
After the game...

993
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:41,997
We...

994
01:08:42,873 --> 01:08:45,209
He took me behind the quad, and we...

995
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:48,712
I can't hear this. You didn't.

996
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:51,882
- No, Mags.
- No.

997
01:08:53,217 --> 01:08:55,010
No.

998
01:08:55,636 --> 01:08:58,305
That's why he dumped me.

999
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:04,353
Mags, hey.

1000
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,064
Hey, hey, it's okay.

1001
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:10,901
You know...

1002
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:15,989
...when you're young, everything feels
like the end of the world.

1003
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,952
It's not.

1004
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:21,912
Right.

1005
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:24,581
It's just the beginning.

1006
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:28,669
You might have to meet
a few more jerks...

1007
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:30,838
...but one day
you're going to meet a boy...

1008
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:34,007
...who treats you the way
that you deserve to be treated:

1009
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:39,346
Like the sun rises and sets with you.

1010
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:47,020
You really think so?

1011
01:09:49,106 --> 01:09:51,108
I know so.

1012
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,945
That's so sweet.

1013
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:57,739
You're the sweetest.

1014
01:09:58,282 --> 01:10:00,325
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

1015
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:01,702
- Ow. Oh.
- Thank you.

1016
01:10:03,453 --> 01:10:07,708
Anyways, I, uh, came over here...
I was looking for you.

1017
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:11,378
I wanted to invite you to my party.
I don't know if you want to come.

1018
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:13,463
- Yes. I would love to.
- Yeah.

1019
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,799
- Great. That's exciting.
- Thank you!

1020
01:10:15,966 --> 01:10:17,759
- Aah! Yay!
- Yes. Yay.

1021
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:19,511
- Thank you.
- That's very exciting.

1022
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:22,306
I know, it's great. Ha, ha.

1023
01:10:22,473 --> 01:10:24,099
See you tonight.

1024
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:33,984
"At Mark's house."

1025
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:57,007
Hey, that's cool. Let me see that.
That is nice, man.

1026
01:10:57,174 --> 01:10:59,259
Don't touch the toys, okay?

1027
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:03,096
Yeah, I'll, uh, try not to light myself
on fire tonight.

1028
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:06,892
- I'll keep a fire extinguisher handy.
- Oh, good.

1029
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:11,188
- Do you want to sit outside?
- Sure.

1030
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:46,974
That's delightful.

1031
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:53,522
What? What?

1032
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:59,736
- Okay, I don't know how to act normal.
- Clearly.

1033
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:04,575
It's the story of my life. I'm not smooth.
I'm just trying to impress you, okay?

1034
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:08,162
I'm not the kind of guy who comes
to places like this. I'm a dork.

1035
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:09,997
The kind of guy who spends 10 grand...

1036
01:12:10,164 --> 01:12:12,749
...on Gandalf the Grey's quarterstaff
from The Two Towers.

1037
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:16,420
Yes, that does make you a dork.

1038
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:22,676
Especially since Gandalf the Grey
was only in Fellowship.

1039
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:27,931
He returns in Two Towers
as Gandalf the White.

1040
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,541
I was upset. I'm sorry, okay?

1041
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:58,045
I need you to show me that you love me.

1042
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,172
And that way
we can get a place together.

1043
01:13:00,339 --> 01:13:03,467
Stop it. Look, whatever.
I'm with somebody else now.

1044
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:07,346
- What?
- Party's over, Stan.

1045
01:13:08,472 --> 01:13:09,640
Just get out of here.

1046
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,520
Oh, yeah?

1047
01:13:15,145 --> 01:13:17,314
Who's gonna make me leave?

1048
01:13:18,857 --> 01:13:19,942
You?

1049
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:23,987
You know I would, but it smells
like you've been drinking...

1050
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:27,074
...so I'm just gonna let the cops do it.

1051
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,747
You can have the nun.

1052
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:36,166
She doesn't put out, anyway.

1053
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,668
On second thought...

1054
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:45,759
Oh, I just had the craziest dream.

1055
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:49,680
I was 17.

1056
01:13:51,265 --> 01:13:54,643
I was back in high school,
and it was terrible.

1057
01:13:58,605 --> 01:14:00,190
Scar.

1058
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:04,778
Scar? I don't see a scar.

1059
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:08,198
Look, I know why you didn't
want me to be with Stan.

1060
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:10,993
It's because you wanted me.

1061
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,832
You want to play games?
I can play games.

1062
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:19,418
- No, no, no.
- I'm a hungry lioness...

1063
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:21,378
...and you're a baby gazelle.

1064
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:25,215
Maggie! No, no, no,
Maggie, stop this now.

1065
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:28,844
If you only knew how highly inappropriate
and dysfunctional this is.

1066
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:30,554
Stop it. Please stop.

1067
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:33,390
Maggie, I'm not the person
that you think I am.

1068
01:14:33,557 --> 01:14:35,142
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

1069
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:37,936
You're right, you're good.
You're not like the others.

1070
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:40,772
I'm not like others.
I'm very different than the others.

1071
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:44,943
So different, in fact, that you and I can
never, ever, ever, ever be together.

1072
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,945
- Stop biting.
- Why?

1073
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:51,658
Oh.

1074
01:14:51,992 --> 01:14:55,787
Oh, my God. What are you saying?

1075
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:57,414
Are you confused?

1076
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,501
I'm very confused, yes.
Extremely confused.

1077
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:05,005
Oh, my God. I... I... I get it now.

1078
01:15:05,422 --> 01:15:10,093
And your hair is always perfectly coiffed,
and you have highlights.

1079
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:14,389
- What are you talking about?
- I mean...

1080
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:17,935
Dude, your jeans are really tight.

1081
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:21,688
I'm not gay.

1082
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:24,817
I'm in love, Maggie. I'm in love.

1083
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:26,652
I've been in love.

1084
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:30,864
I've been in love with the same girl
since I was 17, Maggie.

1085
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:37,788
Does she go to our school? Do I know her?
Tell me her name. I want to know her name.

1086
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:40,082
- No, Maggie. No.
- Okay.

1087
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:46,213
You tell your girlfriend
she better keep a close eye on you.

1088
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:53,470
Sweet baby Jesus.

1089
01:15:55,305 --> 01:15:56,849
Thanks.

1090
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,535
We'll take the check.

1091
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,715
I'm so dead.

1092
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:35,387
Excuse me.

1093
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:39,349
- Scarlet? Scarlet? Scarlet.
- Hi.

1094
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:41,351
- What are you doing here?
- You seen Alex?

1095
01:16:41,518 --> 01:16:43,479
He's not picking up his phone.

1096
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:45,481
Alex is fine. Alex is fine, believe me.

1097
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:47,691
In fact, with the way things are going...

1098
01:16:47,858 --> 01:16:51,195
...by the end of the night
Alex could have a girlfriend.

1099
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:54,656
- Alex has a girlfriend?
- Yeah, and she's great. She's cute.

1100
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:56,408
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Where?

1101
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:59,495
Walk up the stairs. Walk with me
for one sec, I'll show you.

1102
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:02,331
So how ever did you get
the newest version of Halo?

1103
01:17:02,498 --> 01:17:04,750
It's not due out for another six months.

1104
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:10,130
Well, let's just say I said some things
to the Make-A-Wish people...

1105
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:12,424
...that I'm not totally proud of.

1106
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:24,812
I'm going to kill him.

1107
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:43,330
Everybody, out!

1108
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:51,046
Oh, no, no.
No! No! No! Not Dr. Philsopholis.

1109
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:55,884
This party is over!

1110
01:17:56,051 --> 01:18:01,557
Unless you want to spend the next
three months in detention, leave! Now!

1111
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,186
Okay. We better go warn Mark.

1112
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:11,942
You really care about him, don't you?

1113
01:18:12,526 --> 01:18:16,196
- Yeah.
- That's nice. That's really nice.

1114
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:19,116
He really needs a male role model.

1115
01:18:19,283 --> 01:18:20,951
- He's a great kid.
- Mm-hm.

1116
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:24,079
You know, they both are.

1117
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:28,625
I think you're a great mother.

1118
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:30,335
Thank you.

1119
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:33,338
He's on the balcony. He's right there.

1120
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:39,303
- Mom?
- This has been a really tough time...

1121
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:42,806
...and you really feel like
part of the family.

1122
01:18:43,098 --> 01:18:47,478
You have no idea how amazing
it is to hear you say that.

1123
01:18:57,696 --> 01:18:58,822
Scarlet.

1124
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:02,117
Scarlet! Scarlet, I'm not Mark, okay?

1125
01:19:02,284 --> 01:19:06,038
- I'm him, I'm me. Scarlet, I'm your husband.
- Will you stop it already?

1126
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:09,500
If you'd listen to me, I am the father
of your children! Scar, let me...

1127
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:12,669
Don't call me that. Don't call me that!

1128
01:19:12,836 --> 01:19:15,589
You are a weirdo little man-child!

1129
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:17,841
Give me two seconds,
and I can explain this!

1130
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:19,510
You are a pervert!

1131
01:19:30,354 --> 01:19:33,607
Get out, and get out, and get out.

1132
01:19:33,774 --> 01:19:35,317
You can leave.

1133
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:42,199
Well, this isn't exactly the
inconspicuous relationship I wanted.

1134
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:46,870
I'm sure now you can see why
I don't date my students' parents.

1135
01:19:48,622 --> 01:19:50,207
I'm sorry.

1136
01:19:56,213 --> 01:20:00,884
I'm sorry. I had no idea that it was
going to get so out of control.

1137
01:20:01,468 --> 01:20:03,470
- Hm.
- Really?

1138
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,562
- Now I'm sorry.
- I guess I deserved that.

1139
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:14,815
The second one was out of line.
It was uncalled for. Sorry.

1140
01:20:14,982 --> 01:20:17,234
Are you okay? I'm really sorry.

1141
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:21,905
Three makes it even. Now we're even.

1142
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:25,701
How are you? You okay?

1143
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:27,202
Yeah.

1144
01:20:36,712 --> 01:20:39,464
And finished.

1145
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:43,260
With the rug area.

1146
01:20:43,427 --> 01:20:45,762
But we've made very good progress.

1147
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:47,764
We deserve a break.

1148
01:20:48,599 --> 01:20:50,476
I lost my family.

1149
01:20:51,935 --> 01:20:52,936
Hey, Mike?

1150
01:20:53,145 --> 01:20:56,773
If it's any consolation,
I think you really did help your kids.

1151
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:00,402
You did your job,
and now the hero can move on.

1152
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:02,613
I don't want to.

1153
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:06,283
Maybe they don't need me anymore,
but I need them.

1154
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,120
Hey, not to be a buzzkill...

1155
01:21:10,287 --> 01:21:11,872
...but you're due in court...

1156
01:21:12,623 --> 01:21:14,291
...in 22 minutes.

1157
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:17,252
Ned, I need more time.

1158
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:20,255
- I have to stop this.
- To the Nedmobile.

1159
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:22,257
- Wait, Ned, Ned, Ned.
- Yes.

1160
01:21:22,424 --> 01:21:26,261
- Pants.
- I should have pants on. Yes.

1161
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,232
Come on, Glenn!

1162
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:41,193
He's nothing but
a glorified midget wrangler.

1163
01:21:41,485 --> 01:21:43,654
You wouldn't be so big
without that vest!

1164
01:21:43,821 --> 01:21:47,366
Grab that thing that's down there.
Grab it. Just hold that up.

1165
01:21:47,533 --> 01:21:49,451
- Where you get this?
- Best 20 ever spent.

1166
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:51,495
Saves me a half hour on my commute.

1167
01:21:51,662 --> 01:21:53,997
Dude, just hold it. Hold it way up.

1168
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:14,893
The whole truth, nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1169
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,353
I do.

1170
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,856
You request a divorce
by the state of California...

1171
01:22:19,022 --> 01:22:21,358
...citing irreconcilable differences.
This correct?

1172
01:22:21,525 --> 01:22:25,445
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Is Michael O'Donnell present?

1173
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:26,822
No, Your Honor.

1174
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:30,033
I take his absence as agreement
to the orders of the divorce.

1175
01:22:34,538 --> 01:22:37,708
- You are not requesting sole custody?
- No, Your Honor.

1176
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,294
"You can't handle the truth!"

1177
01:22:41,545 --> 01:22:42,629
What?

1178
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:46,008
I'm sorry, I panicked. It was the
first thing that came into my mind.

1179
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:48,802
Your Majesty.

1180
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:51,305
- Who are you?
- That's my husband's best friend.

1181
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,183
You a lawyer, best friend?

1182
01:22:55,058 --> 01:22:56,560
- Yes.
- No.

1183
01:22:56,727 --> 01:23:00,063
I believe the law degree
in my pocket says so.

1184
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:04,735
Yes, and it's a little bit smeared
because I sat on it in the car...

1185
01:23:04,902 --> 01:23:08,197
...not because I printed it out recently.

1186
01:23:11,492 --> 01:23:14,161
Let's pretend that's real.
Want to explain what you're doing?

1187
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:16,538
We...

1188
01:23:17,498 --> 01:23:19,833
...are stopping a gross...

1189
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:23,086
...miscarriage ofjustice!

1190
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:25,297
That...

1191
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:29,051
Okay, if you'd just let me explain.
I can explain this.

1192
01:23:29,218 --> 01:23:30,594
If you would just listen...

1193
01:23:30,761 --> 01:23:34,640
I've got a letter from Mike O'Donnell,
he's the husband in this case!

1194
01:23:34,807 --> 01:23:36,308
I'm sorry. We're in the middle...

1195
01:23:36,475 --> 01:23:39,895
Your Honor, if it's okay,
I'd like to hear the letter, please.

1196
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:49,238
Thank you, Your Honor.

1197
01:23:52,032 --> 01:23:54,159
This is a letter from Mike O'Donnell.

1198
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:56,286
He wanted me to read it.

1199
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:01,208
"Scarlet...

1200
01:24:03,085 --> 01:24:05,254
...before you go through with this...

1201
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:09,716
...I want to remind you
of September 7th, 1988.

1202
01:24:12,094 --> 01:24:13,929
It was the first time that I saw you.

1203
01:24:16,431 --> 01:24:18,559
You were reading Less Than Zero.

1204
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:22,938
You were wearing
a Guns N' Roses T-shirt.

1205
01:24:25,315 --> 01:24:27,985
I'd never seen anything so perfect.

1206
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,950
I remember thinking
that I had to have you, or I'd die.

1207
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:39,997
Then you whispered that you loved me...

1208
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:45,002
...at the homecoming dance.

1209
01:24:48,672 --> 01:24:50,174
And I felt...

1210
01:24:51,008 --> 01:24:52,759
...so peaceful...

1211
01:24:54,928 --> 01:24:56,472
...and safe.

1212
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,727
Because I knew that no matter
what happened from that day on...

1213
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:04,396
...nothing could ever be that bad.

1214
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:06,982
Because I had you.

1215
01:25:08,942 --> 01:25:10,277
Uh...

1216
01:25:11,028 --> 01:25:12,571
And then I grew up...

1217
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:16,033
...and I lost my way.

1218
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:21,622
And I blamed you for my failures.

1219
01:25:25,959 --> 01:25:29,046
And I know that you think
you have to do this today.

1220
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:32,883
I don't want you to.

1221
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:39,389
But I guess...

1222
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:44,728
...if I love you...

1223
01:25:48,357 --> 01:25:50,526
...I should let you move on."

1224
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:56,365
All right, son, you need to go now.

1225
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,389
Let's proceed.

1226
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,269
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Would it be okay...

1227
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:28,397
...if we postpone
this for now for just a little while?

1228
01:26:28,564 --> 01:26:30,232
Would that be okay?

1229
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,901
Postponed 30 days. Next case.

1230
01:26:59,678 --> 01:27:01,972
Haven't seen you practice
this hard since school.

1231
01:27:02,139 --> 01:27:05,184
Yeah, you know, if I want
to impress these college scouts...

1232
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:07,769
...then I need to stay focused.

1233
01:27:07,936 --> 01:27:11,440
Wait, wait. You're not still trying
to get a scholarship, are you?

1234
01:27:12,024 --> 01:27:15,986
Be careful, man. You do not want
to get off of the spirit path.

1235
01:27:16,153 --> 01:27:20,616
There's no path, Ned! There's no path!
I can't do it!

1236
01:27:20,866 --> 01:27:22,534
I just made it worse for them.

1237
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:27,498
My wife is happier, everyone's happier
with me out of the picture, Ned.

1238
01:27:28,207 --> 01:27:29,958
It's time to move on.

1239
01:28:02,366 --> 01:28:04,117
It's time to go, Mom.

1240
01:28:18,215 --> 01:28:21,051
Hey, Gold, save something
for the game, huh?

1241
01:28:21,218 --> 01:28:23,137
Just warming up, coach.

1242
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:25,556
Got a little inside info for you.

1243
01:28:25,722 --> 01:28:29,268
The scout from Ohio State is back,
and the coach is with him.

1244
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:32,146
You play half the game
I know you're capable of...

1245
01:28:32,312 --> 01:28:34,982
...you're going to be playing
college ball next year, huh?

1246
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:37,151
- That's the plan, coach.
- Give me the ball.

1247
01:28:39,736 --> 01:28:43,031
All right, gather up, jockstraps.
Picture time.

1248
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:45,075
Try not to break the camera.

1249
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:33,957
I can't wait to go to Georgetown
and start dating college boys.

1250
01:29:38,795 --> 01:29:42,424
I thought Mark was hanging out
with Alex to get to me, not you.

1251
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:46,011
All right, ladies, let's bring it in.

1252
01:29:48,263 --> 01:29:50,808
Jane! Jane!

1253
01:29:51,642 --> 01:29:54,478
Jane! I'm sorry, sorry.

1254
01:29:54,728 --> 01:29:56,647
- Ned, Ned, Ned.
- Oh, sorry.

1255
01:29:56,814 --> 01:29:59,566
- Ned. Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

1256
01:30:00,818 --> 01:30:02,945
- I need to talk to you.
- What are you doing?

1257
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:05,113
I practiced this, uh.

1258
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,782
Okay.

1259
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:13,455
I have just seen my best friend lose
everything than means anything to him.

1260
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:15,374
And maybe we'll never be there, but...

1261
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:20,337
Yes, I understand, but I have told you
before that I am the principal...

1262
01:30:20,504 --> 01:30:22,965
- Yes.
...and I cannot be seen...

1263
01:30:23,132 --> 01:30:24,633
...with my students' parents.

1264
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,011
But, Jane,
how can you be seen with me...

1265
01:30:28,178 --> 01:30:30,806
...when I'm wearing
the cloak of invisibility?

1266
01:30:33,308 --> 01:30:37,437
Jane, all I'm asking is a chance
for us to be friends.

1267
01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:41,441
Because you're the one
I want by my side...

1268
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:44,945
...when I'm storming
the Elvish Castle of Ganakinesh.

1269
01:30:50,826 --> 01:30:52,953
You can plunder my dungeon anytime.

1270
01:30:53,245 --> 01:30:55,038
I'll bring my long bow.

1271
01:30:55,956 --> 01:30:58,667
Warriors! Yeah!

1272
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:03,213
Come on.

1273
01:31:16,894 --> 01:31:18,729
Oh, my God.

1274
01:31:18,896 --> 01:31:20,898
Mom? Are you okay?

1275
01:31:22,316 --> 01:31:25,527
I can't be here again. I have to go.

1276
01:31:46,215 --> 01:31:48,550
- The game. That's your future.
- The baby's my future.

1277
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:52,721
That's crazy, Mike.
No, I can't let you throw this all away.

1278
01:31:52,888 --> 01:31:54,223
Bye, Mike.

1279
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:55,849
High school star.
Never lived up to potential.

1280
01:31:56,016 --> 01:31:58,519
- What are you doing?
- I want to live in the past.

1281
01:31:58,685 --> 01:32:01,730
I'll bet you wish you had it to
do all over again.

1282
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:03,190
Hello?!

1283
01:32:03,357 --> 01:32:05,108
It's a classic transformation story.

1284
01:32:05,984 --> 01:32:08,111
Spirit guide?

1285
01:32:08,445 --> 01:32:10,531
You and me, we're in this together.

1286
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:14,535
It's your turn now.

1287
01:32:22,292 --> 01:32:23,293
Traveling.

1288
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,962
Green ball!

1289
01:32:25,295 --> 01:32:27,297
O'Donnell, get in there!

1290
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:28,882
Scarlet!

1291
01:32:30,259 --> 01:32:31,635
Scar?

1292
01:32:33,262 --> 01:32:34,805
Scarlet?

1293
01:32:53,115 --> 01:32:54,700
It is you.

1294
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:02,708
Hi.

1295
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:05,627
"Hi"?

1296
01:33:07,337 --> 01:33:08,464
I can explain.

1297
01:33:10,466 --> 01:33:11,842
You can?

1298
01:33:12,009 --> 01:33:13,927
No, not at all.

1299
01:33:15,512 --> 01:33:19,391
- You didn't have to come after me again.
- Yes, I did, because I love you.

1300
01:33:20,184 --> 01:33:23,312
You're the best decision
I ever made, I just forgot.

1301
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:29,318
And then I fell off a bridge
and things got pretty weird after that.

1302
01:33:29,485 --> 01:33:31,737
But I'm never going to forget again.

1303
01:33:33,322 --> 01:33:37,034
Look, I know that I've been
in a bad mood for the last...

1304
01:33:37,659 --> 01:33:39,161
...20 years.

1305
01:33:40,204 --> 01:33:44,666
But if you let me, I swear, I will spend
the rest of my life making it up to you.

1306
01:33:46,043 --> 01:33:48,712
I thought I wanted
a second chance at life...

1307
01:33:48,879 --> 01:33:52,424
...but now I know I just want
a second chance with y...

1308
01:33:56,136 --> 01:33:57,513
Weird.

1309
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,223
Yeah.

1310
01:34:01,058 --> 01:34:02,684
I missed you.

1311
01:34:09,733 --> 01:34:14,696
Yeah, I'm gonna put you down
because this was a lot easier before.

1312
01:34:15,364 --> 01:34:18,826
Yeah, you did have that six-pack
thing going.

1313
01:34:18,992 --> 01:34:20,869
Is there any chance I'll see that again?

1314
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:23,705
I knew you were checking me out.

1315
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:29,545
Go! Go! Go!

1316
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:34,550
Adults can have that, though.

1317
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:37,553
Well, I'll work on it.
Maybe I'll jog home.

1318
01:34:45,018 --> 01:34:46,061
Ned, hey.

1319
01:34:46,228 --> 01:34:49,690
I packed up all my stuff and I wanted
to give your key back and say thanks.

1320
01:34:49,857 --> 01:34:51,316
Hey, whoa. No. No.

1321
01:34:51,483 --> 01:34:54,862
Wasn't expecting to see
you there, Principal Masterson.

1322
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:57,156
You look very pretty.

1323
01:34:57,322 --> 01:34:58,365
Thank you.

1324
01:34:58,532 --> 01:35:00,117
The Force is strong in this one.

1325
01:35:00,284 --> 01:35:02,828
So I guess I'll be
seeing you at work, boss.

1326
01:35:02,995 --> 01:35:05,539
Oh, yes, uh, Coach O'Donnell.

1327
01:35:05,706 --> 01:35:08,917
And, um, we are very happy
to have you aboard.

1328
01:35:09,626 --> 01:35:12,880
Buddy, I got you a little something
for your first day at your new job.

1329
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:15,924
Don't think about how much it cost,
it's not much.

1330
01:35:17,968 --> 01:35:20,053
Hey, you got me a whistle.

1331
01:35:21,472 --> 01:35:22,639
Don't blow it.

1332
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:26,393
Play big.

1333
01:35:27,186 --> 01:35:28,270
You too.

1334
01:35:29,938 --> 01:35:31,648
- Good luck.
- Love you!

1335
01:35:31,815 --> 01:35:33,317
Love you!
