<p>This text is concerned with the development <em class="emph">of</em> FFmpeg itself. Information
on using the FFmpeg libraries in other programs can be found elsewhere, e.g. in:
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>the installed header files
</li><li><a class="url" href="http://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/index.html">the Doxygen documentation</a>
generated from the headers
</li><li>the examples under <samp class="file">doc/examples</samp>
</li></ul>

<p>For more detailed legal information about the use of FFmpeg in
external programs read the <samp class="file">LICENSE</samp> file in the source tree and
consult <a class="url" href="https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html">https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html</a>.
</p>
<p>If you modify FFmpeg code for your own use case, you are highly encouraged to
<em class="emph">submit your changes back to us</em>, using this document as a guide. There are
both pragmatic and ideological reasons to do so:
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Maintaining external changes to keep up with upstream development is
time-consuming and error-prone. With your code in the main tree, it will be
maintained by FFmpeg developers.
</li><li>FFmpeg developers include leading experts in the field who can find bugs or
design flaws in your code.
</li><li>By supporting the project you find useful you ensure it continues to be
maintained and developed.
</li></ul>

<p>All proposed code changes should be submitted for review to
<a class="url" href="mailto:ffmpeg-devel@ffmpeg.org">the development mailing list</a>, as
described in more detail in the <a class="ref" href="#Submitting-patches">Submitting patches</a> chapter. The code
should comply with the <a class="ref" href="#Development-Policy">Development Policy</a> and follow the <a class="ref" href="#Coding-Rules">Coding Rules</a>.
The developer making the commit and the author are responsible for their changes
and should try to fix issues their commit causes.

<h3 class="section"><span>2.1 Language<a class="copiable-link" href="#Language"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>FFmpeg is mainly programmed in the ISO C11 language, except for the public
headers which must stay C99 compatible.
</p>
<p>Compiler-specific extensions may be used with good reason, but must not be
depended on, i.e. the code must still compile and work with compilers lacking
the extension.
</p>
<p>The following C99 features must not be used anywhere in the codebase:
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>variable-length arrays;

</li><li>complex numbers;

</li><li>mixed statements and declarations.
</li></ul>

<h4 class="subsection"><span>2.1.1 SIMD/DSP<a class="copiable-link" href="#SIMD_002fDSP-1"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<a class="anchor" id="SIMD_002fDSP"></a>
<p>As modern compilers are unable to generate efficient SIMD or other
performance-critical DSP code from plain C, handwritten assembly is used.
Usually such code is isolated in a separate function. Then the standard approach
is writing multiple versions of this function â€“ a plain C one that works
everywhere and may also be useful for debugging, and potentially multiple
architecture-specific optimized implementations. Initialization code then
chooses the best available version at runtime and loads it into a function
pointer; the function in question is then always called through this pointer.
</p>
<p>The specific syntax used for writing assembly is:
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>NASM on x86;

</li><li>GAS on ARM and RISC-V.
</li></ul>

<p>A unit testing framework for assembly called <code class="code">checkasm</code> lives under
<samp class="file">tests/checkasm</samp>. All new assembly should come with <code class="code">checkasm</code> tests;
adding tests for existing assembly that lacks them is also strongly encouraged.

</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Other-languages">
<h4 class="subsection"><span>2.1.2 Other languages<a class="copiable-link" href="#Other-languages"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>Other languages than C may be used in special cases:
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Compiler intrinsics or inline assembly when the code in question cannot be
written in the standard way described in the <a class="ref" href="#SIMD_002fDSP">SIMD/DSP</a> section. This
typically applies to code that needs to be inlined.

</li><li>Objective-C where required for interacting with macOS-specific interfaces.

<p>There are the following guidelines regarding the indentation in files:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Indent size is 4.

</li><li>The TAB character is forbidden outside of Makefiles as is any
form of trailing whitespace. Commits containing either will be
rejected by the git repository.

</li><li>You should try to limit your code lines to 80 characters; however, do so if
and only if this improves readability.

</li><li>K&amp;R coding style is used.

<p>The presentation is one inspired by &rsquo;indent -i4 -kr -nut&rsquo;.

<div class="section-level-extent" id="Comments">
<h3 class="section"><span>2.3 Comments<a class="copiable-link" href="#Comments"> &para;</a></span></h3>
<p>Use the JavaDoc/Doxygen  format (see examples below) so that code documentation
can be generated automatically. All nontrivial functions should have a comment
above them explaining what the function does, even if it is just one sentence.
All structures and their member variables should be documented, too.
</p>
<p>Avoid Qt-style and similar Doxygen syntax with <code class="code">!</code> in it, i.e. replace
<code class="code">//!</code> with <code class="code">///</code> and similar.  Also @ syntax should be employed
for markup commands, i.e. use <code class="code">@param</code> and not <code class="code">\param</code>.
</p>

<div class="section-level-extent" id="Naming-conventions-1">
<h3 class="section"><span>2.4 Naming conventions<a class="copiable-link" href="#Naming-conventions-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Names of functions, variables, and struct members must be lowercase, using
underscores (_) to separate words. For example, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">avfilter_get_video_buffer</samp>&rsquo;
is an acceptable function name and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">AVFilterGetVideo</samp>&rsquo; is not.
</p>
<p>Struct, union, enum, and typedeffed type names must use CamelCase. All structs
and unions should be typedeffed to the same name as the struct/union tag, e.g.
<code class="code">typedef struct AVFoo { ... } AVFoo;</code>. Enums are typically not
typedeffed.
</p>
<p>Enumeration constants and macros must be UPPERCASE, except for macros
masquerading as functions, which should use the function naming convention.
</p>
<p>All identifiers in the libraries should be namespaced as follows:
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>No namespacing for identifiers with file and lower scope (e.g. local variables,
static functions), and struct and union members,

</li><li>The <code class="code">ff_</code> prefix must be used for variables and functions visible outside
of file scope, but only used internally within a single library, e.g.
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">ff_w64_demuxer</samp>&rsquo;. This prevents name collisions when FFmpeg is statically
linked.

</li><li>For variables and functions visible outside of file scope, used internally
across multiple libraries, use <code class="code">avpriv_</code> as prefix, for example,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">avpriv_report_missing_feature</samp>&rsquo;.

</li><li>All other internal identifiers, like private type or macro names, should be
namespaced only to avoid possible internal conflicts. E.g. <code class="code">H264_NAL_SPS</code>
vs. <code class="code">HEVC_NAL_SPS</code>.

</li><li>Each library has its own prefix for public symbols, in addition to the
commonly used <code class="code">av_</code> (<code class="code">avformat_</code> for libavformat,
<code class="code">avcodec_</code> for libavcodec, <code class="code">swr_</code> for libswresample, etc).
Check the existing code and choose names accordingly.

</li><li>Other public identifiers (struct, union, enum, macro, type names) must use their
library&rsquo;s public prefix (<code class="code">AV</code>, <code class="code">Sws</code>, or <code class="code">Swr</code>).
</li></ul>

<p>Furthermore, name space reserved for the system should not be invaded.
Identifiers ending in <code class="code">_t</code> are reserved by
<a class="url" href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/xsh_chap02_02.html#tag_02_02_02">POSIX</a>.
Also avoid names starting with <code class="code">__</code> or <code class="code">_</code> followed by an uppercase
letter as they are reserved by the C standard. Names starting with <code class="code">_</code>
are reserved at the file level and may not be used for externally visible
symbols. If in doubt, just avoid names starting with <code class="code">_</code> altogether.

<p>The code must be valid. It must not crash, abort, access invalid pointers, leak
memory, cause data races or signed integer overflow, or otherwise cause
undefined behaviour. Error codes should be checked and, when applicable,
forwarded to the caller.

<p>Our libraries may be called by multiple independent callers in the same process.
These calls may happen from any number of threads and the different call sites
may not be aware of each other - e.g. a user program may be calling our
libraries directly, and use one or more libraries that also call our libraries.
The code must behave correctly under such conditions.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Robustness"><span>Robustness<a class="copiable-link" href="#Robustness"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>The code must treat as untrusted any bytestream received from a caller or read
from a file, network, etc. It must not misbehave when arbitrary data is sent to
it - typically it should print an error message and return
<code class="code">AVERROR_INVALIDDATA</code> on encountering invalid input data.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Memory-allocation"><span>Memory allocation<a class="copiable-link" href="#Memory-allocation"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>The code must use the <code class="code">av_malloc()</code> family of functions from
<samp class="file">libavutil/mem.h</samp> to perform all memory allocation, except in special cases
(e.g. when interacting with an external library that requires a specific
allocator to be used).
</p>
<p>All allocations should be checked and <code class="code">AVERROR(ENOMEM)</code> returned on
failure. A common mistake is that error paths leak memory - make sure that does
not happen.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="stdio"><span>stdio<a class="copiable-link" href="#stdio"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>Our libraries must not access the stdio streams stdin/stdout/stderr directly
(e.g. via <code class="code">printf()</code> family of functions), as that is not library-safe. For
logging, use <code class="code">av_log()</code>.

<p>This means unfinished code which is enabled and breaks compilation,
or compiles but does not work/breaks the regression tests. Code which

<h4 class="subheading" id="Commit-messages"><span>Commit messages<a class="copiable-link" href="#Commit-messages"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>Commit messages are highly important tools for informing other developers on
what a given change does and why. Every commit must always have a properly
filled out commit message with the following format:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">area changed: short 1 line description

details describing what and why and giving references.
</pre></div>

<p>If the commit addresses a known bug on our bug tracker or other external issue
(e.g. CVE), the commit message should include the relevant bug ID(s) or other
external identifiers. Note that this should be done in addition to a proper
explanation and not instead of it. Comments such as &quot;fixed!&quot; or &quot;Changed it.&quot;
are not acceptable.
</p>
<p>When applying patches that have been discussed at length on the mailing list,
reference the thread in the commit message.

<p>If it works for you, others, and passes FATE then it should be OK to commit
it, provided it fits the other committing criteria. You should not worry about
over-testing things. If your code has problems (portability, triggers
compiler bugs, unusual environment etc) they will be reported and eventually
fixed.

<p>They should be split them into self-contained pieces. Also do not forget
that if part B depends on part A, but A does not depend on B, then A can
and should be committed first and separate from B. Keeping changes well
split into self-contained parts makes reviewing and understanding them on
the commit log mailing list easier. This also helps in case of debugging
later on.
Also if you have doubts about splitting or not splitting, do not hesitate to

<p>We refuse source indentation and other cosmetic changes if they are mixed
with functional changes, such commits will be rejected and removed. Every
developer has his own indentation style, you should not change it. Of course
if you (re)write something, you can use your own style, even though we would
prefer if the indentation throughout FFmpeg was consistent (Many projects
force a given indentation style - we do not.). If you really need to make
indentation changes (try to avoid this), separate them strictly from real
changes.
</p>
<p>NOTE: If you had to put if(){ .. } over a large (&gt; 5 lines) chunk of code,
then either do NOT change the indentation of the inner part within (do not
move it to the right)! or do so in a separate commit

<div class="section-level-extent" id="Library-public-interfaces">
<h3 class="section"><span>3.4 Library public interfaces<a class="copiable-link" href="#Library-public-interfaces"> &para;</a></span></h3>
<p>Every library in FFmpeg provides a set of public APIs in its installed headers,
which are those listed in the variable <code class="code">HEADERS</code> in that library&rsquo;s
<samp class="file">Makefile</samp>. All identifiers defined in those headers (except for those
explicitly documented otherwise), and corresponding symbols exported from
compiled shared or static libraries are considered public interfaces and must
comply with the API and ABI compatibility rules described in this section.
</p>
<p>Public APIs must be backward compatible within a given major version. I.e. any
valid user code that compiles and works with a given library version must still
compile and work with any later version, as long as the major version number is
unchanged. &quot;Valid user code&quot; here means code that is calling our APIs in a
documented and/or intended manner and is not relying on any undefined behavior.
Incrementing the major version may break backward compatibility, but only to the
extent described in <a class="ref" href="#Major-version-bumps">Major version bumps</a>.
</p>
<p>We also guarantee backward ABI compatibility for shared and static libraries.
I.e. it should be possible to replace a shared or static build of our library
with a build of any later version (re-linking the user binary in the static
case) without breaking any valid user binaries, as long as the major version
number remains unchanged.

<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Adding-new-interfaces">
<h4 class="subsection"><span>3.4.1 Adding new interfaces<a class="copiable-link" href="#Adding-new-interfaces"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>Any new public identifiers in installed headers are considered new API - this
includes new functions, structs, macros, enum values, typedefs, new fields in
existing structs, new installed headers, etc. Consider the following
guidelines when adding new APIs.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Motivation"><span>Motivation<a class="copiable-link" href="#Motivation"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>While new APIs can be added relatively easily, changing or removing them is much
harder due to abovementioned compatibility requirements. You should then
consider carefully whether the functionality you are adding really needs to be
exposed to our callers as new public API.
</p>
<p>Your new API should have at least one well-established use case outside of the
library that cannot be easily achieved with existing APIs. Every library in
FFmpeg also has a defined scope - your new API must fit within it.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Replacing-existing-APIs"><span>Replacing existing APIs<a class="copiable-link" href="#Replacing-existing-APIs"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>If your new API is replacing an existing one, it should be strictly superior to
it, so that the advantages of using the new API outweight the cost to the
callers of changing their code. After adding the new API you should then
deprecate the old one and schedule it for removal, as described in
<a class="ref" href="#Removing-interfaces">Removing interfaces</a>.
</p>
<p>If you deem an existing API deficient and want to fix it, the preferred approach
in most cases is to add a differently-named replacement and deprecate the
existing API rather than modify it. It is important to make the changes visible
to our callers (e.g. through compile- or run-time deprecation warnings) and make
it clear how to transition to the new API (e.g. in the Doxygen documentation or
on the wiki).
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="API-design"><span>API design<a class="copiable-link" href="#API-design"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>The FFmpeg libraries are used by a variety of callers to perform a wide range of
multimedia-related processing tasks. You should therefore - within reason - try
to design your new API for the broadest feasible set of use cases and avoid
unnecessarily limiting it to a specific type of callers (e.g. just media
playback or just transcoding).
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Consistency"><span>Consistency<a class="copiable-link" href="#Consistency"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>Check whether similar APIs already exist in FFmpeg. If they do, try to model
your new addition on them to achieve better overall consistency.
</p>
<p>The naming of your new identifiers should follow the <a class="ref" href="#Naming-conventions">Naming conventions</a>
and be aligned with other similar APIs, if applicable.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Extensibility"><span>Extensibility<a class="copiable-link" href="#Extensibility"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>You should also consider how your API might be extended in the future in a
backward-compatible way. If you are adding a new struct <code class="code">AVFoo</code>, the
standard approach is requiring the caller to always allocate it through a
constructor function, typically named <code class="code">av_foo_alloc()</code>. This way new fields
may be added to the end of the struct without breaking ABI compatibility.
Typically you will also want a destructor - <code class="code">av_foo_free(AVFoo**)</code> that
frees the indirectly supplied object (and its contents, if applicable) and
writes <code class="code">NULL</code> to the supplied pointer, thus eliminating the potential
dangling pointer in the caller&rsquo;s memory.
</p>
<p>If you are adding new functions, consider whether it might be desirable to tweak
their behavior in the future - you may want to add a flags argument, even though
it would be unused initially.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Documentation"><span>Documentation<a class="copiable-link" href="#Documentation"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>All new APIs must be documented as Doxygen-formatted comments above the
identifiers you add to the public headers. You should also briefly mention the
change in <samp class="file">doc/APIchanges</samp>.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Bump-the-version"><span>Bump the version<a class="copiable-link" href="#Bump-the-version"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>Backward-incompatible API or ABI changes require incrementing (bumping) the
major version number, as described in <a class="ref" href="#Major-version-bumps">Major version bumps</a>. Major
bumps are significant events that happen on a schedule - so if your change
strictly requires one you should add it under <code class="code">#if</code> preprocesor guards that
disable it until the next major bump happens.
</p>
<p>New APIs that can be added without breaking API or ABI compatibility require
bumping the minor version number.
</p>
<p>Incrementing the third (micro) version component means a noteworthy binary
compatible change (e.g. encoder bug fix that matters for the decoder). The third
component always starts at 100 to distinguish FFmpeg from Libav.
</p>
<a class="anchor" id="Removing-interfaces"></a></div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Removing-interfaces-1">
<h4 class="subsection"><span>3.4.2 Removing interfaces<a class="copiable-link" href="#Removing-interfaces-1"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>Due to abovementioned compatibility guarantees, removing APIs is an involved
process that should only be undertaken with good reason. Typically a deficient,
restrictive, or otherwise inadequate API is replaced by a superior one, though
it does at times happen that we remove an API without any replacement (e.g. when
the feature it provides is deemed not worth the maintenance effort, out of scope
of the project, fundamentally flawed, etc.).
</p>
<p>The removal has two steps - first the API is deprecated and scheduled for
removal, but remains present and functional. The second step is actually
removing the API - this is described in <a class="ref" href="#Major-version-bumps">Major version bumps</a>.
</p>
<p>To deprecate an API you should signal to our users that they should stop using
it. E.g. if you intend to remove struct members or functions, you should mark
them with <code class="code">attribute_deprecated</code>. When this cannot be done, it may be
possible to detect the use of the deprecated API at runtime and print a warning
(though take care not to print it too often). You should also document the
deprecation (and the replacement, if applicable) in the relevant Doxygen
documentation block.
</p>
<p>Finally, you should define a deprecation guard along the lines of
<code class="code">#define FF_API_&lt;FOO&gt; (LIBAVBAR_VERSION_MAJOR &lt; XX)</code> (where XX is the major
version in which the API will be removed) in <samp class="file">libavbar/version_major.h</samp>
(<samp class="file">version.h</samp> in case of <code class="code">libavutil</code>). Then wrap all uses of the
deprecated API in <code class="code">#if FF_API_&lt;FOO&gt; .... #endif</code>, so that the code will
automatically get disabled once the major version reaches XX. You can also use
<code class="code">FF_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS</code> and <code class="code">FF_ENABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS</code>
to suppress compiler deprecation warnings inside these guards. You should test
that the code compiles and works with the guard macro evaluating to both true
and false.

<h4 class="subsection"><span>3.4.3 Major version bumps<a class="copiable-link" href="#Major-version-bumps-1"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>A major version bump signifies an API and/or ABI compatibility break. To reduce
the negative effects on our callers, who are required to adapt their code,
backward-incompatible changes during a major bump should be limited to:
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Removing previously deprecated APIs.

</li><li>Performing ABI- but not API-breaking changes, like reordering struct contents.

<p>First, read the <a class="ref" href="#Coding-Rules">Coding Rules</a> above if you did not yet, in particular
the rules regarding patch submission.
</p>
<p>When you submit your patch, please use <code class="code">git format-patch</code> or
<code class="code">git send-email</code>. We cannot read other diffs :-).
</p>
<p>Also please do not submit a patch which contains several unrelated changes.
Split it into separate, self-contained pieces. This does not mean splitting
file by file. Instead, make the patch as small as possible while still
keeping it as a logical unit that contains an individual change, even
if it spans multiple files. This makes reviewing your patches much easier
for us and greatly increases your chances of getting your patch applied.
</p>
<p>Use the patcheck tool of FFmpeg to check your patch.
The tool is located in the tools directory.
</p>
<p>Run the <a class="ref" href="#Regression-tests">Regression tests</a> before submitting a patch in order to verify
it does not cause unexpected problems.
</p>
<p>It also helps quite a bit if you tell us what the patch does (for example
&rsquo;replaces lrint by lrintf&rsquo;), and why (for example &rsquo;*BSD isn&rsquo;t C99 compliant
and has no lrint()&rsquo;)
</p>
<p>Also please if you send several patches, send each patch as a separate mail,
do not attach several unrelated patches to the same mail.
</p>
<p>Patches should be posted to the
<a class="uref" href="https://lists.ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel">ffmpeg-devel</a>
mailing list. Use <code class="code">git send-email</code> when possible since it will properly
send patches without requiring extra care. If you cannot, then send patches
as base64-encoded attachments, so your patch is not trashed during
transmission. Also ensure the correct mime type is used
(text/x-diff or text/x-patch or at least text/plain) and that only one
patch is inline or attached per mail.
You can check <a class="url" href="https://patchwork.ffmpeg.org">https://patchwork.ffmpeg.org</a>, if your patch does not show up, its mime type
likely was wrong.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Sending-patches-from-email-clients"><span>Sending patches from email clients<a class="copiable-link" href="#Sending-patches-from-email-clients"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>Using <code class="code">git send-email</code> might not be desirable for everyone. The
following trick allows to send patches via email clients in a safe
way. It has been tested with Outlook and Thunderbird (with X-Unsent
extension) and might work with other applications.
</p>
<p>Create your patch like this:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">git format-patch -s -o &quot;outputfolder&quot; --add-header &quot;X-Unsent: 1&quot; --suffix .eml --to ffmpeg-devel@ffmpeg.org -1 1a2b3c4d
</pre>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll just need to open the eml file with the email application
and execute &rsquo;Send&rsquo;.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Reviews"><span>Reviews<a class="copiable-link" href="#Reviews"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>Your patch will be reviewed on the mailing list. You will likely be asked
to make some changes and are expected to send in an improved version that
incorporates the requests from the review. This process may go through
several iterations. Once your patch is deemed good enough, some developer
will pick it up and commit it to the official FFmpeg tree.
</p>
<p>Give us a few days to react. But if some time passes without reaction,
send a reminder by email. Your patch should eventually be dealt with.

Reviews and comments will be posted as replies to the patch on the

that can be by resubmitting a changed patch or by discussion. Resubmitted
patches will themselves be reviewed like any other patch. If at some point
a patch passes review with no comments then it is approved, that can for
simple and small patches happen immediately while large patches will generally
have to be changed and reviewed many times before they are approved.
After a patch is approved it will be committed to the repository.

<p>If you need a sample uploaded send a mail to samples-request.
</p>
<p>When there is no muxer or encoder available to generate test media for a
specific test then the media has to be included in the fate-suite.
First please make sure that the sample file is as small as possible to test the
respective decoder or demuxer sufficiently. Large files increase network
bandwidth and disk space requirements.
Once you have a working fate test and fate sample, provide in the commit
message or introductory message for the patch series that you post to
the ffmpeg-devel mailing list, a direct link to download the sample media.

<h3 class="section"><span>8.2 Visualizing Test Coverage<a class="copiable-link" href="#Visualizing-Test-Coverage"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>The FFmpeg build system allows visualizing the test coverage in an easy
manner with the coverage tools <code class="code">gcov</code>/<code class="code">lcov</code>.  This involves
the following steps:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> Configure to compile with instrumentation enabled:
    <code class="code">configure --toolchain=gcov</code>.

</li><li> Run your test case, either manually or via FATE. This can be either
    the full FATE regression suite, or any arbitrary invocation of any
    front-end tool provided by FFmpeg, in any combination.

</li><li> Run <code class="code">make lcov</code> to generate coverage data in HTML format.

</li><li> View <code class="code">lcov/index.html</code> in your preferred HTML viewer.
</li></ol>

<p>You can use the command <code class="code">make lcov-reset</code> to reset the coverage
measurements. You will need to rerun <code class="code">make lcov</code> after running a
new test.

<div class="section-level-extent" id="Using-Valgrind">
<h3 class="section"><span>8.3 Using Valgrind<a class="copiable-link" href="#Using-Valgrind"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>The configure script provides a shortcut for using valgrind to spot bugs
related to memory handling. Just add the option
<code class="code">--toolchain=valgrind-memcheck</code> or <code class="code">--toolchain=valgrind-massif</code>
to your configure line, and reasonable defaults will be set for running
FATE under the supervision of either the <strong class="strong">memcheck</strong> or the
<strong class="strong">massif</strong> tool of the valgrind suite.
</p>
<p>In case you need finer control over how valgrind is invoked, use the
<code class="code">--target-exec='valgrind &lt;your_custom_valgrind_options&gt;</code> option in
your configure line instead.

<h2 class="chapter"><span>9 Release process<a class="copiable-link" href="#Release-process-1"> &para;</a></span></h2>

<p>FFmpeg maintains a set of <strong class="strong">release branches</strong>, which are the
recommended deliverable for system integrators and distributors (such as
Linux distributions, etc.). At regular times, a <strong class="strong">release
manager</strong> prepares, tests and publishes tarballs on the
<a class="url" href="https://ffmpeg.org">https://ffmpeg.org</a> website.
</p>
<p>There are two kinds of releases:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> <strong class="strong">Major releases</strong> always include the latest and greatest
features and functionality.

</li><li> <strong class="strong">Point releases</strong> are cut from <strong class="strong">release</strong> branches,
which are named <code class="code">release/X</code>, with <code class="code">X</code> being the release
version number.
</li></ol>

<p>Note that we promise to our users that shared libraries from any FFmpeg
release never break programs that have been <strong class="strong">compiled</strong> against
previous versions of <strong class="strong">the same release series</strong> in any case!
</p>
<p>However, from time to time, we do make API changes that require adaptations
in applications. Such changes are only allowed in (new) major releases and
require further steps such as bumping library version numbers and/or
adjustments to the symbol versioning file. Please discuss such changes
on the <strong class="strong">ffmpeg-devel</strong> mailing list in time to allow forward planning.

<h3 class="section"><span>9.1 Criteria for Point Releases<a class="copiable-link" href="#Criteria-for-Point-Releases-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Changes that match the following criteria are valid candidates for
inclusion into a point release:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> Fixes a security issue, preferably identified by a <strong class="strong">CVE
number</strong> issued by <a class="url" href="http://cve.mitre.org/">http://cve.mitre.org/</a>.

</li><li> Fixes a documented bug in <a class="url" href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org">https://trac.ffmpeg.org</a>.

</li><li> Improves the included documentation.

</li><li> Retains both source code and binary compatibility with previous
point releases of the same release branch.
</li></ol>

<p>The order for checking the rules is (1 OR 2 OR 3) AND 4.

</div>
<div class="section-level-extent" id="Release-Checklist">
<h3 class="section"><span>9.2 Release Checklist<a class="copiable-link" href="#Release-Checklist"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>The release process involves the following steps:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> Ensure that the <samp class="file">RELEASE</samp> file contains the version number for
the upcoming release.

</li><li> Add the release at <a class="url" href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/admin/ticket/versions">https://trac.ffmpeg.org/admin/ticket/versions</a>.

</li><li> Announce the intent to do a release to the mailing list.

</li><li> Make sure all relevant security fixes have been backported. See
<a class="url" href="https://ffmpeg.org/security.html">https://ffmpeg.org/security.html</a>.

</li><li> Ensure that the FATE regression suite still passes in the release
branch on at least <strong class="strong">i386</strong> and <strong class="strong">amd64</strong>
(cf. <a class="ref" href="#Regression-tests">Regression tests</a>).

</li><li> Prepare the release tarballs in <code class="code">bz2</code> and <code class="code">gz</code> formats, and
supplementing files that contain <code class="code">gpg</code> signatures

</li><li> Publish the tarballs at <a class="url" href="https://ffmpeg.org/releases">https://ffmpeg.org/releases</a>. Create and
push an annotated tag in the form <code class="code">nX</code>, with <code class="code">X</code>
containing the version number.

</li><li> Propose and send a patch to the <strong class="strong">ffmpeg-devel</strong> mailing list
with a news entry for the website.

</li><li> Publish the news entry.

</li><li> Send an announcement to the mailing list.
